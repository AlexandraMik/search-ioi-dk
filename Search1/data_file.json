play style half legacyhalf current mapssounds like an awesome mix with good a variety too please tell us about some of the contracts youve chosen created and why you chose themi know that colorado is

    "text": "the may contract curator is here and ready hes a wellknown figure and mod on hitman forum and discord hes a very creative soul and often creates humorous mind puzzling contracts and shares hilarious and complex videos this also results in some very interesting ways to take out elusive targets you can play his 11 curated contracts now in hitman 2but now lets take some time and get to know him a bit better and find out more about where he gets his crazy ideas fromurben nice to meet youhey glad to be herecan you give us some intel on who you areyou already summarized me well for what i do at hitman so let me add something more personalim from germany and currently try to find my place in the software industry i am an analytic yet also a creative mind who likes to put that into use not only in gaming but also programming lets see where this leads me toi am eagerly using the internet to find inspiring things interesting people and also use it to learn i do that since i was a kid which made me appreciate the value of the digital sphere because of that i am also involved in some political activities when i see this space in danger i also try to inform others from time to time as you can easily miss these thingsif people want to see more of what you do where can they watchfollow you onlinei am most active on hitmanforum but also on discord like the official hitman one or the discord of frote7s speedrun community you can find all my creative videos on my youtube channelgreat now lets go back in time when did you first stumble upon the bald assassinmy first hitman game was blood money i did not play it as much as the recent games but i played through it multiple times with joy the level i remember the most is you better watch out vertical maps are always special and i love to climb or sneak my way to an advantage point and pull off kills from multiple levels below or aboveits also a classic but lets circle in on the games what is your favorite hitman game and whythe current ones by far with hitman 2 taking the lead i think the formula was there quite much in older hitman games but with all these ways to interact multiple startingexit locations pickup locations items and so on i can only say this is a huge lethal holiday simulator sandbox that i cannot imagine to find in any other franchiseso keeping it around hitman 2 what is your favourite map everyone saying it is sapienza is boring so i go with isle of sgil while it feels a bit too much as the fortress it actually is i already said i love vertical maps and this surely is one of them and the atmosphere is just beautifulnow weve talked about your favourite game and map but what in general has been your favourite moment in hitman can be anything from ingame to something youve seen played etchard to say as i did and saw so much it almost became regular business but what really stood out was being invited to the gamescom to meet you and some cool players from the community to test the upcoming hitman 2 it even topped having the studio creative director of io talking about one of my videos as one of the most creative kills that he has seen so far right there at the e3 i still wait for my medal by the way also finding myself in haven was very specialfinding once self is always special so urben you create many awesome videos for hitman if you should point out one of your personal best which one is it it is the weaponized parrot kill on the revolutionary it is not only about the idea but also the presentation and i think i reached a peak with both of them therean older one that is also nice to watch is the 250000000 pound sterling big one throw where i throw the big one on a propane flask the explosion accelerates it to another flask where the target stands the music the slow motion and the fact the target must see the big one coming for him nails itcomplexity seems to be a theme here whats the most complex thing youve done in hitmanthere are many complicated things i did i know you want my answers to be short but you literally ask for it with this onei did this sniper double kill in world of tomorrow the same bullet kills franny and later silvio in his plane at 730min in the video the shot was very hard to do as the travel time of the bullet made it impossible to guess when to shoot i always missed the plane so i had to apply some sciencewhat i did was pausing the game when his plane was where i want to hit it and made a screenshot of the map so i have his position then i looked for a place for 47 on the map to shoot a notmoving object that is equally far away there i did a test shot on the object also in slow motion recorded it went to my video editor and measured the time from trigger to impact i applied the same time to a recording of the actual point of view of the kill to see where caruso has to be on my screen to hit the triggerbut there was another problem i did not find an object to shoot at for the test even from edgetoedge the map was too small for that distance so instead i shot at a bell of the boat that is related to the kraken easter egg but that one is not marked on the map how do i find out its positioni aimed on the bell from multiple positions on the map so i could use the direction indicator of 47s position symbol on the map to draw the lines of sight where the lines crossed was the position of the bell on the map with that knowledge i found out that shooting the boats bell from the churchs bell oh the irony is pretty much the very same distance i was looking for the rest was the described math with my video editornow contracts timeshare with us howd you went about choosingcreating finding the 11 contracts what was your processi began collecting contracts way before you asked me as i am slow at this i had a short list of people that are quite creative so i tried to include a contract from each of them but that was not enough so i went through the hitman 2 contract thread on hmf yes all 3k posts but i still had not enough so i reinstalled hitman 2016 and went through the contract thread for this game yes all 10k posts luckily this way i could also include other creative people that are less active these days that also made up for me turning down the offer to become the last hitman 2016 curatori also tweaked some contracts labelled as remix i want that to be understood as a collaboration a new concept that makes the batch more special not as some attempt to fix something i wanted the cool ideas to fit better in what i tried to accomplish with this batchlegacy remix and mashup this is awesome your 11 picks are now playable in hitman 2 can you tell us about the contracts youve chosen created and why you chose themevery contract offers multiple solutions for example in the accidental gardener santa fortuna by kent you can either infiltrate the tunnels or set up traps when starting there undercoverevery contract can also be speedrun which means there is always a way to spend time usefully bookend beauties paris by euler13 kind of requires you to not waste too much time as you cannot ko the targets and need to keep them isolated before returning with the required axesstill every contract should be enjoyable if you take your time you dont even need mastery for any of them in theoryalthough i could not resist to include a narrower contract that really tests your creativity perfect shooter puzzle miami by whitehalfand as a finish you get to uh meet me in haven in another tricky contract i made myself please be gentlelet us go a little behind the screen herepreparation is key what is the one item you always take into a contract with you and why do you like it so muchi often have my preset loadout contain stuff from my last elusive target so i happen to start contracts often with the big one or laser tripwire in my pockets i am more than happy if i am able to make use of them in the most obscure wayshaha laser tripwire in pockets you play a dangerous game urben if you should sum up what makes contracts so special for youthe maps the tools and the ways to combine them is my main enjoyment in these games i loved lego as a kid and i kind of do the same here now please keep on making unique pieces i can put togetherif it exists what makes the perfect contractthe perfect contract offers a puzzle to solve and a way to bypass it with more effort if you dont like that it can also be done fast but does not push you if you dont want to it limits you to become creative but is still open enough if you want to do things your way and you come back to it because after finishing it you have new ideas new knowledge you want to try outwhat i personally try is to wrap that up in an appearance that makes the contract look easier than it is according to munga i am successful at thiswere almost at the end urben so now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go have at itif you like contracts and missed out my featured ones in hitman 2016 you are in luck with the help of mulletpride the best of them are ready to be played on all platformsor if you want to get into contract creation yourself let me help you with this huge guide that contains many tips about what makes a generally enjoyable contract join us whenever clemens is asking for submissions for featured contractsand finally i thank all

he gets his contracts passionkevinrudd nice to meet yougday matecan you give us some intel on who you aresome may think of me as a former prime minister jk or am i but to the rest of the hitman community im that guy who keeps coming up with a buttload of contracts first the sniper series now all sorts of interesting types and posting them on reddit and hitmanforum im also that guy who keeps posting ansel pictures on reddit from the game i like to think i have other contributions toowe do remember your awesome sniper contracts quite well where can people findwatchfollow you onlineyou can find me as ualban3se on reddit where ive been posting something every single night this year apart from a brief holiday and as kevinrudd on hmf where im active in the contract ansel picture and other threads of people trying to get the most out of the gameand well get back to your ansel skills later on but first when did you first stumble upon the bald assassinthe first time i played a hitman game was in either 2002 or 2003 hitman 2 silent assassin at my brothers house ever since then i was hookedwe all are can you tell us what hitman game is your favorite and whywould have to be the current game hitman 2 with all dlc truly a world of assassination theres always a reason to come back to each location youre not confined to just one mission take advantage of the big maps and world thats been craftedexcellent point so talking about hitman 2 whats your favourite locationi have to mention that sapienza is the best location in the franchise of all time soz but its true but for hitman 2 maybe miami big and civilianoriented are my favourite new york is very polished and has nice music though and haven island is a bit of fun but the real question is when are we getting an australia mapwell new zealand is relatively close to australia wouldnt you say anyways whats your favourite moment in hitman can be anything from ingame to something youve seen played etcbeing picked as a curator is pretty cool almost as cool as winning an election but i enjoyed the challenge of coming up with a sniper contract for every single map in the game cant wait to do it for h3s levels whatever they arehint hint developers make sure every map has cool sniping spots quite an awesome collection of sniper contracts and awesome pictures for them as well tell us a bit about where you draw your ansel inspirationif i wasnt a prime minister in this life not saying im not but hypothetically if i wasnt then you could say i studied film and television and have a strong interest in that stuff so i know a bit about composing a shot with a real camera and if you get the ansel unlocked cheat on pc then it functions a lot like a real camera can except it floats magically in the air so much better than real camera there are some cool settings interesting characters and humorous happenings to get shots of in this game oh yeah and some of the glitches are funny too now lets talk contractslets start by talking about your curator batch how did you go about choosingcreating finding the 10 11 contracts what was your processi used detailed programmatic specificity and weeks of replaying old contracts thanks covid19 to come up with the final listif this batch has a theme itd be variety i wanted to choose contracts that covered every single aspect of this vast game if thats even possible and i tried to spread it across as many maps as possible essentially all of these contracts come from the hitmanforum contract thread its really the only place to go if youre after contracts that arent killing the gate guard in the tutorial map i also like contracts that have a premise to them beyond just kill these people lelive made it my mission to come up with a variety of contract types the past year so ive also gone through my own to find ones which arent a very common category the rest are from those who have their own types theyre good at makingwith the theme of variety in mind some of the categories youll find in this batch are infiltration puzzle sniper loud gun freedom speedrun explosive nonassassination skills and challenge i dont like elaborate restrictive contracts although i put in one that sort of comes close for people who really want to be challengedi want the less adventurous players out there who havent given certain styles or types a shot to see this batch play it and go oh i havent done that before but i like it and maybe even learn something new about how things in the game workbrilliant idea and variety as a theme is greatwe thought it would be cool to use kevenrudds ansel skills so we asked him to take a picture for his contracts and write a little teaser for each i never wear a rubberwill you overcome breathing problems and make a lot of noisewhich color has your collaris it better to be a janitor who looks up to bankers or a banker who looks down on janitorswhats that soundif a bomb goes off in the suburbs and no one is alive to hear it does it make a soundknockouthow do you feel about taking dead peoples clothessniper assassin castle mk iican you be a silent assassin from a single rooftophokkaido fastballhow do you get around dressed like thatgrand theft boscoredactedarrive hide leavecan you solve a puzzle without fancy gadgetswildcardrelax and just have fun with this oneevictioncan you fulfil all the conditionsripe for the pickingcan you figure out the secrets of the vents or will you do things the old fashioned way now lets go a bit behind the screens herewhat is the one item you always take into a contract with you and why do you like it so muchthere isnt any one item i take in with me every time as i play a lot of puzzle contracts in which you have to figure out very specific items to bring but 95 of the time i take at least either the silverballerkrugermeier or sieker silenced pistol is good for everything kills distractions causing a panic destroying cameras and the sieker is useful for getting people out of the way peacefully but mainly is funnythe silverballer classic move mr rudd please share with us what makes contracts special for youany game that lets its players come up with content is good in my books ive probably spent too much time in contracts mode now i pray it will be expanded upon in the next game but i like all the mini puzzles etc you can make for other players to figure out or have fun withfinal question mr rudd what makes the perfect contracti dunno about perfect but youve done a bloody good job if theres something special or unique about your contract but doesnt require super special knowledge of a glitch that only 2 of players know about stuff like a contract which can only be done if you make use of the food server function or makes use of special itemsmachines in a map like the crane in mumbai you can drop on people or the air vents in various levels or an excuse to use loud guns or bombs but still get silent assassin because theres so many items in the game but theyll rarely get used because theyre not very stealthytime is almost up kevenrudd so now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go have at itif you like the game but think youve run out of stuff to do ive gotten 890 hrs personally consider custom contracts it can hard be hard to sort though and find the good ones but this thread has lots of tips on how to find them and a categorised list of contracts i like if you enjoy my curated batch as well as other peoples picksthank you so much for your time kevinrudd and thanks for giving us and the community the opportunity to get to know you a bit better thank you or as they say in mandarin xi xi ni mr clemens youve given me a fair shake of the sauce bottle and made an old prime minister smile",

but the game looked awesome first hitman game i owned myself was hitman 2 silent assassinwhat about your favourite hitman game and whyhas to be hitman 2016 simple reason is that its the game where i had the most fun with and put the most time ina solid choice what about the most recent game whats your favourite map from hitman 2if we are strictly speaking hitman 2 maps miami closely followed by the bank if we are including legacy then paris is still the best map by farwhats your favourite moment about the hitman franchise this could be anything from ingame to something youve seen or made etcif were talking about ingame its the first time playing paris i was so impressed and overwhelmed felt like a kid in a candy store outside of the game its getting invited to ioi hq amp the hitman 2 event at gamescom in the summer of 2018 but my upmost favorite moment was meeting adoria my girlfriend via hitmana true hitman love story speaking of other community members we know that youve setup a speedrunning community tell us moreit started out as a one time thing i wanted to organize a speedrun competition with some prizes mulletpride then offered to help me by setting up a discord for me and making some artwork the response was so overwhelmingly positive that i was highly motivated to continue in 2019 weve had 3 big speedrun competitions 1 ghost mode tournament and a bunch of weekly competitionsnow in 2020 were stepping up our game the year is divided in 4 seasons each season consisting of 3 months each month will have 1 big competition including prize money 2 minicompetitions and batch of our own featured contracts made by previous months winners we also provide lots of live commentary for our big eventsweve had the roulette rivals event in january ghost mode tournament 2 is currently underway and we got speedrun competition 4 coming up in march this week we reached 500 members on our discord which is just incredibly awesomeand the best thing of all participating in our events is completely free so if you want to put your hitman skills to the test learn a lot about the mechanics of the game and meet cool players from a very active and friendly community join our discord were obviously happy to see such a popular community take shape and its about speedrunning can you share why speedrunning is so greatthis is a very good question and one that i thought about quite a lot is it the competitive aspect the sense of satisfaction when pulling off a cool run getting to truly understanding of the games mechanics the pure joy and entertainment of watching a run evolve over time a mix of it all well i found this video that touched on some very good points and explains it better than i couldbut in short its simply very very funnow time to talk about contractscan you share your secret on how you went about choosingcreating finding the 10 contracts what was your processi started the process by looking at redacted in my opinion when selecting contracts you always have to take redacted into account because else you will run into redacted once that is done i look at which redacted would add a lot for redacted its not a long or difficult process but its very important to not forget about redactedaha guess not fair then can you tell us about the contracts youve chosen created and why you chose themits a mix ive picked several from our speedrun competitions since they are simply very good contracts i also wanted a good fiber wire suit only contract in there and finally picked some quality contracts from masters like urben and euler13 despite people was expecting me to have picked 10 paris contracts no go each map only gets featured once hahasmart move okay final question when you normally start a contract what is that one item you always bring and why do you like it so muchnone it all depends on the contract im playing and what i need for that particular one but the silenced pistol is still the best itemweapon in the game its just so versatileversatile and a classic love it okay we know we said the final question but this is the final final question why the clown suithaha i feel like it represents my personality i think its the best out of all the suits and at this point me and that particular suit has become inseparablethat was the all the questions frote7 so now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go the floor is yourswant to start by giving a huge shoutout to my admin team mulletpride adoria fuzk scroobi amp karma our speedrun community would not have been what it is without your help love you guysshoutout to the people helping us to promote our competitions and to all the great runners special mention for my bro mendietinha last but not least make sure to tune in for the

the other awesome people at io interactive its an honor to chat with you guyscan you give us some intel on who you areappropriate question seeing as how i havent been in the hitman community all that long i go by mullet and before you even ask no i dont have a mullet not anymore decided to get rid of that when i became a father but now i have a fancy moustache and most of the community members like to tease me for that i am soon to be 27 years old and live in ohio in the united states besides grinding your game i also like to writeplay music i play disc golf religiously i play in an indoor soccerfootball league and one day i would like to publish a book i work as a project manager in a factory where we build heaters and i also work as a farmhand parttime in the spring and summerwhere can people findwatchfollow you onlineyou can find me on twitch where i like to stream hitman and a variety of singleplayer campaign games most recently i played horizon zero dawn and hitman 2 on stream i also try to make good hitman content on my youtube channel frote7 inspired me to do speedrunning videos and urben inspired me to do funnymontage videos i play hitman on both ps4 and xb1 and can be addedfollowed there too lastly i have a twitter account that i can be followed onwhen did you first stumble upon the bald assassinback when i had an xbox 360 hitman absolution was made free with the games with gold access so i downloaded it and played it through twice even though its not one of the fanfavorites in the series i have a special spot in my heart for it since i would never be around the newer hitman games without itwhat is your favourite hitman game and whyhitman 2 2018 is my favorite hitman game and it goes back to what i said earlier i havent been in the hitman scenecommunity for a very long time i played absolution twice through and then i played hitman 2016 as a completionist i went for all of the challenges in each map but i didnt even know what elusive targets were or even try the contracts game mode i followed the game and community much closer upon hitman 2s release and learned that there is much more to the game besides playing the main missions repeatedlywhats your favourite map from hitman 2if were speaking strictly new hitman 2 maps i would have to say miami if you want to extend that to the legacy pack i would have to say sapienza miami has a wonderful energy to it across the entire map i love the vibrant colors the racetrack is a unique addition that we hadnt seen before and ive played countless contracts that i thoroughly enjoyed from here sapienza is the same for similar reasons involving the aura colors and contracts sapienza also has many biomes that all have a nice setting for featuring contracts may it be the mansion the beachchurch area or the underground caveand whats your favourite moment in hitman can be anything from ingame to something youve seen played etcobviously being the first curator of hitman 2 and first curator of the decade haha i actually have to give credit to frote7 again for this one he was streaming hitman 2 on twitch and mentioned wanting to set up his own speedrun competition i told him that i could set up a discord server for him to organize this event and i could also make him promotional art to help spread the word this was back in august 2019 and not even five months later the community discord has risen to well over 400 members frote7 and i have hosted 3 speedrun competitions and a ghost mode tournament all of which have brought in some of the most skilful and competitive hitman players across the globe i guess the tldr would be cohosting events with my buddy frote editors note want in on the speedrun discord click this link to joinnow contracts timehow did you go about choosingcreatingfinding the 10 contracts what was your processi had a private message from clemens immediately after the last io monthly asking if i would like to be the curator after a brief omg moment and accepting the role he told me to keep things on the lowdown while also giving me almost complete freedom on selecting contracts rather than selecting contracts that i had already played i actually asked specific friends content creators and contract masters to make me a new contract i didnt tell them that it was going to be used in the curator batch but rather told them to make a contract similar to previous ones that i had played so other than maybe one or two of these contracts i will be playing them for the first time with the rest of the communitythats definitely a different way to do it and thats your call as the curator tell us more about the contracts youve chosen to give our community an idea of what to expecti can group some of my contracts into different categories based on why i like them the first style of contractgameplay i want to highlight is speedrunning im in no way one of the best speedrunners but i really do enjoy this style of play my favorite types of contracts to speedrun are any method any disguise or maybe limiting to one method andor one disguise i enjoy freedom in a contract because it gives many different approaches to the same few targets hitman is after all a puzzle game and i just like to put the puzzle together as fast as possible this leads to my next type of contractstyle of play which are elaborate puzzles or roleplaying contracts have you ever played a contract and just thought for a while how in the hell do i go about even doing this i love these contracts and it is very satisfactory to finally complete themlets talk a bit more about how you like to approach a hitman level is there a particular item that you just need to have in your loadouthonestly i always enjoy having a briefcase with me i would say that i always want to bring a sniper rifle with me but that isnt always the best means of eliminating targets the briefcase is great for concealing whatever items especially a sniper rifle but also doubles as a great throwable melee weapon besides that the briefcase just looks professional while wearing a suit and i like that professional assassin looknow is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go have at ita special shoutout to mr ding scroob and penny the group of us created our own campaign within hitman 2 called apa a contract series there is a full story written throughout the briefings one contract in each location minus hawkes bay these contracts have been expertly put together using our apa conditions accident kill pistol kill any method they have been exposed on hitman forum already but i want to shout them out again we did apa part 1 in the legacy pack maps and wrapped up the series in apa part 2 in the h2 maps some of these are simple and quick some of them are very puzzling hope you enjoy them editors note if you want to find the apa contracts this hitmanforum thread that mullet mentioned above has all the idsthanks mulletthank you guys for having me and thank you for doing what you guys do ive never played a game with a live service such as hitman 2 and i think it is underappreciated cant wait to see me as an npc in the next hitman game hehe come on do it and also hyped for the new ip whatever that may be thee u",

the blackwater penthouse level for hours trying stealth runs kill everyone runs everything then a few years ago i went to live in hokkaido for a year i somehow heard there was a new hitman and it had a hokkaido level so i picked it up and have loved it since mainly contract creationmy contract this december is all about the chimneys sapienza has a unique mechanic of being able to blow up fireplaces by dropping propane flasks down chimneys so this contract is all about becoming santa and delivering some presents to a few naughty npcs but dont try and fit down the chimney youre not the real santa on the second day of contractsser die nacken nie klingencreated by urben contract briefingfamilies couples and friends come together to share warmth and closenessit is cold and dark outside

it i often build rube goldberg machines to kill my targets creatively and put the results into videosas these things are hard to pull off and i still want people to enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game i also spend much time at creating contracts i always try to condensate it down to a specific unique task you never happened to come across before and if the contract offers room for different solutions without tedious work then i call it a good contractthis time in my contract ser die nacken nie klingen a play of words on a german christmas song you have to snap necks you probably did that a lot of times before but you will learn here that snapping necks of conscious targets is actually loud enough to be noticed i am eager to see how you kill them behind the bar in paris when after

but hitman is still greateven though i have played hitman games for such a time i had not ever joined any of the forums until this yeari just had to get one of my contracts featured for this gameas for this specific contract i wanted to present a theme that could blend with the other holiday contracts without making it a real holiday contract a lot of people have different beliefs or celebrate holidays other than christmas so i made the story about a biker nicknamed santathe complications were added to make this a little spicy on the sixth day of contractsoffice christmas partycreated by

includes creating hitman contractsyou can say that i like to entertain people while doing it creativelyit wasnt always like this though i used to be into sportsbut one day i realized that i dont belong in any kind of sport environment so i started with movie making insteadi was heavily inspired by youtube music videos from 2005 2009however copyright strikes can be a problem if youre the new guy with no knowledge about iti guess you can say i learned the hard way since i moved over to video game movies a few years later or less after starting my youtube channel which decreased the risk of getting strikes at the timeso anyway i was invited thx for that btw which is the reason why i ended up here making a christmas gift for youenjoy 12 days of contracts and happy holidaysi was looking for christmas inspiration when i randomly stumbled into one of these kill count videos from krampus 2015 hes basically the opposite of santaevil santa kinda according to the video krampus likes to give people gifts freeze them to death and he likes to drag his victims aroundhe also have this kill i guess were he send this kid down to some kind of hell anyway the stuff you will do in my contract

never seeing children in a hitman game but i always found the griswold property quite eerie all the childrens toys lie around in the back garden but there is not a child in sightthis was the inspiration for the contract a cross between the concept of the christmas grinch figure who stole the fun from christmas with the story of the pied piper of hamelin who led all the children away never to be seen again consequently the setting including the briefing is particularly grislyim hoping that the sight of the evil elves lounging around in the griswold property the chief demonic elf leaning up against his illgotten sports car and the final two despicable elves standing next the magical sleigh will anger those who play this contract enough to serve some brutal justice on themthe kill requirements for three of the targets have been carefully included to add a layer of challenge to the contract and hopefully make it a fun puzzle to solvemerry hunting 47s on the eleventh day of

and trying to think deadly d out of the box with its amazing creativity freedomi hope youll have fun playing as santa at my santa fortuna contract which combines my favorite accident kill method with the concept of taking back gifts from naughty kids who are on the listhappy hohoholidays this is my santafortuna submission for christmasrico and his guards have been acting naughty all this year and santa has them on his list hohohorrible accidents he delivers amp takes back all gifts delivered i originally created this to showcase an easy way to drown rico outside mansion before the doorbells jingle him away eventually this evolved into an open ended multiaccident challengemany combinations of accidents can be achieved including drownings explosions electrocutionsrico can also be doublekilled with each of the other 3 targets hohohostart point is the bus smuggled point provided right away amp useful items in the level are the propane flask amp car battery nearby more propane flasks await at mansion and another car battery at garage water puddles motorbikes and cars can be used amp weapon drops found by others can manipulate specific guards into movingyou can be fast and

circumstances weve been able to reproduce this at the studio and a hotfix is currently being tested we dont have an eta for when it will be released yet but will share an update when we doknown issues 2720weve listed some of the games known issues below so that you know were aware weve always got eyes on the technical support and bug report threads on the forums and reddit too so if youve reported something there we almost definitely know about it our november update 2720 is the final patch planned for hitman 2 and all remaining known issues will therefore be placed into the hitman 2 backlogto save us from writing it repeatedly we are aware of an issue wherepc players are experiencing 0x8000000 and related crashesstatus we recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use dx12 as this has been reported to fix the issue at this time we dont have a specific fix planned however we have been made aware of some community workarounds that may ease the issue for people continuing to encounter this issuethe sa rating is not failed when a dead body is found if a tranquilizer was used before the lethal killstatus this is an issue with many components and to avoid creating any further issues we have decided to place this issue in the hitman 2 backlogfire extinguishers and propane flasks do not explode when an explosive is detonated on themstatus this issue is situationally dependent on certain factors including how many items there are in the room and the radius of the potential explosionhold my hair challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic poison causing npcs to find the nearest trashcan rubbish bin instead of a toiletstatus we have made some handcrafted tweaks to the setup for specific trashcans to allow challenges to be completed more reliably namely those in hokkaido that are needed to complete the snow festival challenge pack a global fix for all trashcans has now been added to the hitman 2 backlogterminus suit elusive target unlock is not unlocked immediately after completing an et with a silent assassin ratingstatus this is a known issue that will potentially affect a small number of players for each elusive target unfortunately we are not able to reproduce the issue and therefore fix it to prevent it from happening however we will fix the issue at the end of each elusive target by awarding the suit to everyone that unlocked it this process can take up to 48 hours from the end of the elusive target endingnovember content roadmapcelebrations are in full swing for hitman 2s anniversary a jampacked month of

legacy elusive targetthe fixer has stumbled back into marrakesh once more and lets be clear about this hes a contentious man during hitman 1 when he first debuted this was the elusive target with the lowest success rate all because of the diamondsduring this contract 47 must retrieve diamonds as one of the objectives and if you subdue or kill any of the characters involved in the diamond exchange before the exchange can happen the contract will fail permanently because 47 will then not be able to retrieve them we strongly advise that you approach this contract with extreme caution and read the briefing and target intel before proceeding november 28 escalationget in get out keep the change thats good advice for the mccallister ransack in whittleton creek over three stages this escalation

items that could be affected by wind effects would visually flicker when 47 is near this only occurred on ps4expansion pass store checkwe have made a backend change to how the ingame store displays ownership of the expansion pass the checkmark was setup to check for whether a player was able to download and play hantu port in expansion pack 1 this was causing an issue for owners of the silver edition who would then see a checkmark for the expansion pass despite only owning expansion pack 1 now the checkmark will only show if a player is able to download and play haven island which is only available through the expansion passreports aka whats not changing in 2710in addition to the above changes we also investigated some communityreported issues that we have deemed to be either as designed or wont fix here is a nonexhaustive list of some of those reportsreport gold bar categorythe gold bar is placed in the melee category because we consider that to be its primary function some reports suggested it would be better placed in distractions we disagreereport ica flash phone categorysimilar to the above report some players have suggested that the ica flash phone be placed in the explosives category because thats where the other flash devices are however phones are considered as tools and so will remain in that category regardless of their functionreport lethal foodthe apple cheeseburger and muffin items have the nonlethal tag because thats how they will be experienced for the overwhelming majority of players whilst it is technically possible to land a final killing blow with any of these three items it would be misleading to label them as lethal which some players have requested reportedreport no bodies foundthe silent assassin rating is currently lost when a player kills a target with an accident or poison and then drags the body which is found by an npc as soon as the body is found the no bodies found bonus is lost and the sa tracker will turn red the key part here is that the body is dragged after the kill this has been the case for as long as we can remember and we have no intention to change it in the near futureknown issues 2710weve listed some of the games known issues below so that you know were aware weve always got eyes on the technical support and bug report threads on the forums and reddit too so if youve reported something there we almost definitely know about itto save us from writing it repeatedly we are aware of an issue wherepc players are experiencing 0x8000000 and related crashesstatus we recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use dx12 as this has been reported to fix the issue this remains an open issue that we are continuing to gather data on to pinpoint the cause at this time we dont have a specific fix plannedplayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in contracts modestatus this issue is caused when using specific items that are required for hidden exits currently the game is unable to detect the status of the item when dropped and so defaults to a fail state weve placed this issue into the hitman 2 backlog as we wont be fixing it in the immediate futureplayers can get stuck in a situation where its impossible to exit some contracts in bangkokstatus this issue is caused in contracts mode when the tuktuk is set as a required exit if the tuktuk is destroyed the contract will not fail and players will then be unable to complete the contract weve placed this issue into the hitman 2 backlog as we wont be fixing it in the immediate futurearea discovery challenges in some particular edge cases do not unlock properlystatus we are confident that this has been fixed on all locations including haven island with the discover paradise fix mentioned above if you do continue to have this issue after completing a clean completion of the affected mission with the 2710 update installed please get in touch with us with specific detailsthe sa rating is not failed when a dead body is found if a tranquilizer was used before the lethal killstatus this is an issue with many components and we are still investigating a fix that doesnt have other impact on the systems that are affectedfire extinguishers and propane flasks no longer explode when an explosive is detonated on themstatus weve made progress on this issue and have had success with fire extinguishers exploding when using a breaching charge propane flask and a gas canister however the issue seems to be situationally dependent on certain factors including how many items there are in the room radius of the potential explosion we are investigating a permanent fixhold my hair challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic poison causing npcs to find the nearest trashcan rubbish bin instead of a toiletstatus we have identified the issue that seems to be causing npc preference to trashcans rather than toilets and made some progress on solving it we are continuing to work towards a permanent solution that would involve having npcs strongly favour a toilet over a trashcanplayers are unable to complete the mission mastery challenge in marrakesh house built on sand and unlock the janbiyastatus we have brought this issue back under the spotlight and working towards a final and definitive fix following player reports that previous fixes have not worked for them the setup for these particular challenges are more complex underthehood than they look we will share a renewed status update next monthterminus suit elusive target unlock is not

work done on our new content haven island amp new special assignments as well as new members of the teamemetic islandweve fixed an issue where the inventory image used for the emetic grenade was displaying as the regular flash grenade the correct image will now be shownknown issuesweve listed some of the games known issues below so that you know were aware weve always got eyes on the technical support and bug report threads on the forums and reddit too so if youve reported something there we almost definitely know about itto save us from writing it repeatedly we are aware of an issue wherepc players are experiencing 0x8000000 and related crashesstatus we recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use dx12 as this has been reported to fix the issue this remains an open issue that we are continuing to gather data on to pinpoint the cause at this time we dont have a specific fix plannedplayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in contracts modestatus this issue is caused when using specific items that are required for hidden exits currently the game is unable to detect the status of the item when dropped and so defaults to a fail state investigations into a permanent fix are ongoingarea discovery challenges in some particular edge cases do not unlock properlystatus we believe that this issue is fixed however we are awaiting confirmation from community members that have helped us to troubleshoot it if you are having this issue please report it to us to expedite this processthe sa rating is not failed when a dead body is found if a tranquilizer was used before the lethal killstatus this is an issue with many components and we are investigating a fix that doesnt have other impact on the systems that are affectedfire extinguishers and propane flasks no longer explode when an explosive is detonated on themstatus weve made progress on this issue and have had success with fire extinguishers exploding when using a breaching charge propane flask and a gas canister however the issue seems to be situationally dependent on certain factors including how many items there are in the room radius of the potential explosion we are investigating a permanent fixhold my hair challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic poison causing npcs to find the nearest trashcan rubbish bin instead of a toiletstatus we have identified the issue that seems to be causing npc preference to trashcans rather than toilets and made some progress on solving it it appears to have stemmed from a previous change for a specific trashcan and we have made some changes in the live game for it but are continuing to work towards a final solutionthe bartoli 12g shotgun new york unlock can be selected as a concealed weapon but cannot actually be concealedstatus we are tracking this and aiming to lock down a permanent solution for how the weapon is configuredterminus suit elusive target unlock is not unlocked immediately after completing an et with a silent assassin ratingstatus whilst the unlock will be awarded properly for most players this is a known issue that we have tracked to affect a small minority of players which will continue to affect the live game however we will fix the issue at the end of each elusive target by awarding the suit to everyone that unlocked it this process can take up to 48 hours from the end of the elusive target endingseptember content roadmapthe september roadmap is almost complete but not quite the angel of death returns for her moment in the spotlight to round out the month before we look ahead to october and the release of some longrequested community content and items look out for full details through the upcoming october roadmap",

scoped to indicate how long it will take agent 47 to add another bullet to the chamber or the time it will take before you can fire another shot this will be only be visible for sniper rifles but on both sniper assassin maps and campaignsandbox missions a similar indicator will also be visible to show the time for a full reloadin the image below you can see the chamber load progression in the bottom righthand third of the scope as well as how many bullets are left in the magazine before you need to reloadthe image also includes some subtle hints to an upcoming expansion pass location currently known only as the resortsniper assassin saweve made a change to ensure that the sniper assassin challenge is unlocked when completing the necessary requirements and earning the sa rating the sa rating is awarded even if a target spots 47 before they can share that knowledge however this logic was not applied to the sniper assassin challenges this meant that it was possible to earn the sa rating but not unlock the sniper assassin challengenot that fastweve made a change to when the exit mission prompt becomes available as a followup to a change we made in april after eliminating the final target there will now be a 3second delay until the exit mission prompt appears and players can exitno evidenceweve fixed an issue where the no evidence challenge does not unlock if either the

recover from falling through the clock to pick up a coin that she had dropped in the process of falling immediately after picking up the coin she would then attempt to lean on the clock again and start falling before somehow managing to recover and pick up the coin that she had dropped beforehostile terminationweve made a change to make it possible for 47 to push athena savalas directly through the clock when she is leaning against it although the prompt says push you should be prepared for agent 47s trademark kick we can also confirm that if savalas is holding a coin she wont be able to recover from the kick to grab it target literally downtwoway conversationweve fixed a communityreported issue in new york where bodies could be seen through the oneway mirror if 47 is in the

for others have funanniversary suitscelebrate 20 years of ioi with these suits inspired by characters from our previous games futo lynch and christoper stone the freedom phantompreviously exclusive to the hitman definitive edition these ingame suits will be be available in hitman 2 for anyone who signs up for a free ioi accountyou can sign up for an account either through the game itself or via the website once youve done that link your game and the suits will be added to your inventory the next time you launch hitman 2 if you already have an ioi account youll get the suits when you next play the game toggle aimafter player feedback we have added the option to choose whether you hold or toggle the aim button by default the option will be set to hold to aim how it has always been but can be changed to toggle aim in the optionsgtgameplaygtweapon aim menu this option affects aiming with guns and rifles including sniper assassin mode but does not affect 47s aiming when throwing this will still require the play to hold the button to move 47s throwing arcgame update 250 whats changingcamera gridsa few months back we made a change where security camera grids were always visible weve now added this as a setting in the optionsgtgameplaygtcamera grid menu this will be set to on by default but can also be changed to offwhen the setting is on camera grids will always be shown whether in instinct or not when set to off camera grids will only be shown when in instinctillegal hud promptsweve made a visual change to alert players when they are about to pick up an illegal item or perform an illegal action previously there would be a small red exclamation point attached to the interaction button now we have added a slightly larger exclamation point next to the interaction button and weve made the interaction circle turn red rather than white when performing the action the ambition with these two small tweaks is to make it more apparent to players that they are about to perform an action that is illegalin the image below you can see that the exclamation mark is easier to identify and that the interaction circle fills with red when the interaction button is pressed downstash iconweve added a small visual change to the stash points ingame eg trash cans that will show a subtle icon to indicate to players that an item has been stashed there currently each stash point has the interaction marker small white square that indicates that you can interact with an item now that interaction marker will be filled in to indicate that an item is stashed therein the example below it is now easier to see that an item is stashed in the trash can the icon is filled in but there is nothing in the briefcase icon is emptyattention spikeweve made three subtle changes to the attention meter to make it easier to know when you are gaining attention and how close you are to becoming compromised or spottedfirstly weve made a change to the colour yellow is the new white and makes it easier to seesecondly the meter will now fill allowing you to see how close you are to being spottedthirdly weve made a technical change to the attention meter to prevent it from not being visible onscreen it was previously a 3d object in the world and in some cases depending on where the camera was positioned it wasnt visible to the playerin the zoomed image below you can see the new colour showing how much attention has been gained the slightly faded yellow shows how much room there is for more attention before the guard will reactwho is thatweve fixed an issue where diana agent 47s handler would not introduce targets and key objectives in some missions she will now do so again in her trademark style however weve made a small tweak to give her a few days off every so often now after hearing diana introduce a target or key objective once she wont introduce that particular target again for a period of 48 hours realtime we expect that this change will make dianas dialogue less intrusive for repeated playthroughs over a short period of time and make her less of a meme whilst maintaining her impact and assistance to 47 note key objectives include things such as the virus in sapienza soders heart in hokkaido etcsa ko oh noweve fixed an issue where the silent assassin rating would be lost if a target was knocked unconscious killed in an accident and then the body was foundsa rules 2weve addressed an issue where the silent assassin rating could be earned with 4 stars because the never spotted bonus was sometimes not being granted after a sa playthrough now the sa rating and all bonuses should be properly awarded after completing a sa playthrough this was sometimes caused by 47 being almostpartially noticed by a target before killing themtweaked assignmentsweve fixed an issue that was preventing blair reddington from completing the entirety of his loop in embrace of the serpent he was skipping two specific steps that also meant that dialogue was not being triggered part of this fix included blair triggering the correct dialogue depending on the status of the chefbank chatterweve fixed an issue in new york the bank where two conversations could overlap in the conference roomtimes upweve fixed an issue where the times up challenge in new york the bank would not always unlock correctlylights outweve fixed an issue where the chandelier in the main hall of the bank would flicker and temporarily disappear after being destroyedbank coverweve fixed some issues with 47 taking cover near the staircase to the ceos floor in the bankshot gunweve addressed an issue where the sawed off bartoli 12g shotgun new york mastery unlock could not be equipped as a starting weapon or placed in an agency pickup the shotgun can now be used in those ways however it can no longer be holstered during gameplay and will instead function like all other shotguns in terms of being placed on 47s back to support these changes weve altered the description of the weapon and renamed it to the customised bartoli 12gupdate this change is temporary and was inadvertently included as part of our investigations into how we could make the weapon work properly with weapon stashes with our next update august we will revert the weapons name and holsterability yes thats a word as well as enabling it to be placed in large stash pointshalfbaked hippoweve fixed an issue where jorge franco would sometimes suspend his routine during the half baked mission storylocked closetweve fixed a communityreported issue where 47 could not exit a specific closet in the crows hideout in mumbai if youre not happy with this fix you can still enter the cupboard and refuse to leavetaxi exitweve fixed a communityreported issue where playermade contracts created in mumbai can be instafailed if the required exit is set to a taxi driver who is then distracted or affected by combatmuffin meleeweve fixed a communityreported issue where muffins and snowballs were categorised as gear they are now correctly placed in the weapons melee categorya quick fixweve fixed an issue where the no evidence challenges would not be completed when players exited a mission despite fulfilling the requirements once cause for this was immediately exiting the mission after eliminating a target weve made it so that a fastexit will still grant the challenge when the requirements are metnote see the known issues below for an outstanding no evidence issuelost itemsweve fixed an issue where thrown items could get stuck out of reach in certain ceilings in mumbai thrown items would cause npcs to investigate the noise in the room aboveroadmap jeppeweve added an option to the featured hub to allow players to view the newest monthly roadmap this will function as a onetime popup message when a new roadmap is

update into two sections this month to highlight whats new and changed versus the outright bug fixes we also want to give a huge shout out to everyone in our community that has brought our attention to many of the changes and fixes in this updaterelease detailsthe february update aka 214 will arrive on february 26 and we expect it to be approximately 1 gb on all platforms the ingame version 214 might differ from the update name that is used by your consolethere will be server maintenance between 1100 and 1400 utcpostrelease reportafter a successful release of the february update 214 on february 26 weve had two days to play the game ourselves on a retail build and gather some player feedback on the changes heres where well give a status update on some of the discussions weve seen and the issues that have been found as a result of the recent updatearea discovery we know about issues regarding these challenges and were working on rolling out a fix well share more details soonupdate a fix has been rolled out and we expect this issue to be resolved launch and complete a mission in the affected location to complete progresssilent assassin tracker some players have seen that a new icon has appeared in the hud this wasntintended to be released in 214 and is an unfinished feature which might not work as expected and shouldnt be relied upon to properly track the silent assassin status however we do plan on releasing a finalised sa tracker in a future updatecloth we are aware of issues where 47s suit and cloth can appear to be stretched were working on a fix for thisupdate we have issued a fix for cloth issues on pc these will be fixed in the march update on consolesadditional were tracking and investigating some issues regarding explosives opening doors and mission exit points were also gathering input on the sniper shot location change that we made that will need a bit more time for us to analyse and compare the videos were seeing from players and what we expect to happenupdate we have some improvements in place for the sniper shot location change ready for our next update in marchfeedback were continuing to track community feedback on the february updategame update 214 whats newlegacy location lightingweve made some lighting enhancements for the legacy locations including the hdr adaptation colorgrading and glowbloom settings heres what to expecthigher dynamic rangeoverall higher contrast providing a more detailed and dramatic imagebetter controlled bloom and flareminor tweaks to sun and sky colours and their relative intensityinventory loadout sortingweve added inventory categories to make it easier to find and choose the items you want to take into a mission loadout selections will be sorted into tabs melee explosives etc that can be individually selectednpc koweve changed the minimap icon for an unconscious npc it was previously a white dot and looked too much like an enforcer now it mimics the hud icon you see above an unconscious npc ingamesniper shot locationweve made a change to how npcs react to weapon fire when they havent seen 47 take the shot previously guards would sometimes immediately approach the location that the shot was taken from and search they might also suppress that location with gunfire too now they will start by searching at the place that the bullet landed and will start to figure out where the shot came from they will only look at where the shot was fired from if they have line of sight to it depending on the circumstances they may also suppress the location and begin to move towards it its important to note that 47 can only be compromised according tothe normal game rules one of the npcs should get close and spothim near the location where the shot originated from and then they can link him to the crimethe complexity of our game and its various potential states makes it difficult to give a full explanation of all of the possible scenarios and reactions that could play out however we expect that this change will reduce any confusion about how and when 47 is spottedcompromised when engaging in long distances especially the unfair feeling that the guards instantly know where 47 is after firing a shotemp disarmingweve made a change to how the remote emp charge is disarmed previously it could be activatedtriggered whilst being carried by an npc and would then be disarmed when the npc secures it in a weapons locker now the emp can be triggered at any point and will not be disarmed to allow for some more unique gameplay opportunitieschallenge removalweve removed 3 challenges from the isle of sgail all the kings men making waves and no budget for a railing after a sweep of the challenges in the game we think that these particular challenges encourage the killing of multiple nontargets and theyre not fun to complete weve also factored community feedback into the decisionplayers who have already unlocked these challenges will retain their xp and progression but each challenge will be removed and the overall number of challenges will be reduced this was previously communicated to players on our twitter account and the february roadmap blog

consistently perform noticed kills once both players have eliminated the target the waiting period for the next target will be 10 seconds or less depending what was on the clock when the second

update in november that allowed players to retain their silent assassin rating even if they were spotted by their target we really like this feature and what it adds to the game unfortunately this change brought with it some changes to gameplay that made it much easier to earn the sa rating essentially you now need to enter a compromised state in order to lose the sa rating rather than just be spottedwere not happy with the way things are currently and were goingto make further changes to keep the sa rating as something that is difficult to earn and feels like a rewarding challenge to complete were already deep into what those changes can be and we will have an update on this specific issue to share in the new yearone final thing we fully acknowledge that weve been slow to respond on this particular matter in future well strive to do better thankswhats next the january updatewere already looking ahead to our january update which will bring more fixes and more improvements as well as some other exciting announcements well also have a full january roadmap to release early next year which is packed full of brand new content were looking forward to it see you there",

selection of contracts for all players to enjoygule is a long time hitman fan from argentina who knows a thing or two about hitman check out his youtube channel for a ton of awesome hitman videoshis chosen contracts will be available to play on22nd june 2018 so lets hear more about themgule can you tell us a bit about who you areno git rkt m8 jk im gule and i do hitman videos and will do hitman 2 soon huehuehuewhere can people findwatchfollow you onlinemainly on my youtube channel i have a twitch channel as well but i dont stream very often theres also the hitman forum and subreddit you can always find me there and i guess ill drop my twitter here huehuehuethis year ioi is celebrating 20 years of making games and wed like to know about the first ioi game that you played can you tell us about thatmy first hitmano game was the very first one codename 47 well actually it was hitman 2 silent assassin which i found on a cybercaf but as soon as i tried it and realized it was the second game i decided to get a totally legit copy of the first one so i could play every game in order absolution wasnt out yet so i played up to blood money and fell in love with the series huehuehuehueso hitman 2 has officially been announced are you excited for november the 13thye boiiiiiiiiii shoutout to the absolute legend parsime who gifted me the gold edition lt3heres his youtube channel great playerin hitman 2 what are you looking forward to the mostnew locations also sasofo runs silent assassin suit only fish onlyhow would you sum up your hitman playstyle are you all about speed puzzle roleplay etcroleplay obviously i like to be immersed when i play i actually invented a whole system thats better than the silent assassin rating which consists of immersion points every time you do something immersive like not pressing the run button for 10 minutes you get points but you lose points every time something that breaks the immersion happens like that time i killed the chameleon with a flying hay bale and lost all of my immersion pointsjust kidding i play with every single play style but for my videos i prefer to go for style points mainly speed usually comes with it so you could say i only upload the speedruns huehuehuehuealright now lets talk contracts there are thousands of out there so how did you go about choosing the 10 contracts for featuringoh boy i never thought choosing contracts would be so hard after playing the first fifty contracts i only liked about 3 of them and one of those 3 didnt even make it i was very picky but i wasnt looking for anything specific like one in each map or a fiber wiresnipermeleepoisonetc contract as long as the contract was good thats all that matters and boy they were not good huehuehuehuehue a lot of people make the same mistakes when making a contract which i think i can talk more about in the next questionluckily it turned out to be a great batch and it has a lot of variety as well we have puzzles melee shotgun sniping a lot of anyany and even a flying katana contract its been a while since we had a flying weapon contract people stopped doing them for some reason huehuehueso what do you think are the necessary requirements to make the perfect contracta good contract needs to be enjoyable regarding your playstyle and have multiple solutions theres no such thing as a perfect contract but theres a lot of things you should try to avoid when making one so here are my pro tips for making contractsthings to avoidsingletarget contracts its almost guaranteed that it will become linear which is all hitman isnt aboutbonus maps theyre usually pretty bad for contracts due to the single starting locationit doesnt have to be 5 targets every time theres nothing wrong with 5 targets but you should make sure each target adds something to the contract if its good with 3 targets its good with 3 targetspicking main mission targets we already have the main missionpicking all the special npcs helmut sheikh sato dexter pilot etc its not only unoriginal but theyre usually bad targets when theyre all together in the same contract ive seen so many like these that i think its worth mentioningbad restrictions restrictions are better when theyre not restricting but adding more possibilities you might ask how is that possible well a good example is one of the featured contracts from this batch unbearable noise 4 targets in hokkaido with suitshotgun restriction that restriction made it so theres a lot of ways to do this contract if the same targets were anyany it wouldnt be nearly as interesting and everyone would probably do the samenote that you can break any of these rules and still make a good contract the mcveigh mishap is a great singletarget contract how many takes does it take from this batch is a sick puzzle contract even though its set in the icon so dont avoid at all costs but consider them huehuehuemoving away from contracts can you remember the first time you failed an elusive target what happenedill just let this video speak for its selfi blame travisheres our last question where would you most like to see 47 travel to in a future gameargentina bring 47 to my house or rito if there is anything else you want to say nows the timemendie told me i should include all of these in my interview so this is perfectuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh wallbang cj top quality

    "text": "may is a very busy month for hitman take a look at the full monthly roadmap to get an overview of everything thats coming your wayonce again weve enlisted a hitman player to be a contract curator and put forward their best selection of contracts for all players to enjoythis month our curator is euler13 hes no stranger to featured contracts and theres a good chance that youve already played at least one of his 15 contracts that have been featured since the game launched he also knows a thing or two about how to subdue charactershis chosen contracts will be available to play on 11th may 2018 so lets hear more about themhello euler13 tell us a bit about who you arein the real world when im not assassinating targets i teach mathematics and computer science sad as this may sound i am absolutely passionate about mathematics my gamertag is a tribute to in my opinion one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived and my hero leonhard eulerwhere can people findwatchfollow you onlinei have a youtube channel euler13 im also an active member of hitman forum id highly recommend the forum to any hitman players who havent discovered it yet its a fantastic community and gives us a great chance to share contracts and talk all things hitmanwe love the hitman forum as well this year ioi is celebrating 20 years of making games and wed like to know about the first ioi game that you played can you tell us about thateven though a day hardly goes by when i dont play hitman 2016 my first real exposure to your games was hitman absolution i realise that this is not a view shared some of those who have been with the franchise for much longer than me but personally i loved absolution i know that a lot of my hitman buddies share a similar experience and it was our gateway into the world of hitman for me it was love at first sight and the reason that i did not hesitate to preorder hitman 2016 i dont have a single regret ive been video gaming since the days of the original atari vcs 2600 but i have never enjoyed any game as much as hitman i will definitely be preordering season 2 as soon as it is officially announced many of us are hoping that there will be an opportunity to begin placing our orders around 1014 june chow would you sum up your hitman playstyle are you all about speed puzzle roleplay etcmy playstyle has evolved and ive dabbled with all of those mentioned i enjoy doing speedruns from time to time and i cannot resist a good puzzle contact but my prefence is a selfimposed suit only infiltration style of play even if the contract allows any disguise there is nothing quite like the adrenaline rush experienced when sneaking through a hostile map such as colorado in my favorite 47s signature suit with gloves but even suit only runs open up so many options recently i did a video series shabby 47 vs smooth 47 in which i completed two suit only runs of all of the main missions using two different playstyles smooth 47 operates like a ghost never subdues anyone and does nothing that would create panic shabby 47 will settle for nothing less than silent assassin rating but hes bold loud and will go to any lengths to get the job donealright now lets talk contracts there are thousands of out there so how did you go about choosing the 10 contracts for featuringmy personal favourites are generally those with one two or three carefully chosen targets however when i chose these contracts to be featured i was acutely aware that they were going to be played by an entire community of players with such a massive variety of preferences so ive tried to pick something for everyone and contrary to my preferences a lot of them have five targets but i hope that those who play them will appreciate how much thought each of the creators has put into their designwhen selecting them i knew that there needed to be a complete mixture of those id categorise as freeflowing speedrun puzzle and infiltration i also had to try to give coverage to most of the maps and allow for different skill levels although its only my opinion i rated the difficulty level of all the contracts that i chose out of 10 with 10 being the most difficult and the mean score was 62 and yes there is one in there that id rate as a 10 im sure that everyone will quickly figure it out which one it is and curse me for selecting but i think its a real masterpiece some seasoned players might feel that there are too many easy contracts but i deliberately chose a number of them because they allowed for any kill method and any disguise so if its too easy then they will have the freedom to make it challenging for themselves and hopefully they can share a video of their insanely good runs to impress the rest of uswhat do you think are the necessary requirements to make the perfect contractagain this is often down to personal opinion but i do think that there are some fundamental principles that are the hallmark of great contracts when searching for random contracts to play i tend to ignore any with the default title kill order and briefing you have been cleared it doesnt mean that they cant be great but if i dont know the creator then it is most likely that someone who cant be bothered to take the time to think of a decent title or briefing has probably not thought much about the targets and kill conditions either they probably just went into the map and marked five random targets and would have marked twenty targets if the game allowed it in other words an excellent contract should show clear evidence that the creator had a theme in mind heshe had thought carefully about the targets and had considered how they should be killed the contract should be tested several times before publishing and the creator should take the time to think about how other players will approach it i believe that getting that balance between challenge fun and freedom is what its all aboutthats awesome moving away from contracts can you remember the first time you failed if ever an elusive target what happenedive never failed an elusive target but i did miss out on silent assassin rating with a couple of the earlier ones the first time round one of my alltime favourites was the prince i still remember starting it with a confident im coming for you swagger and being horrified when i found the church in complete lockdown i knew the sapienza map inside out but i soon realised that would count for nothing i was going to need a really good plan i still dont know what i did wrong but somehow someone somewhere saw me the other et that i didnt get silent assassin on was the enjoyable and hilarious gary busey contract i used a ducky on a scooter and the explosion of the duck killed him rather than the scooter so it didnt count as an accident kill schoolboy errorwhen ioi first announced elusive targets none of us really knew what to expect but im sure that i speak for the vast majority of the community in saying that they turned out to be an unexpectedly awesome experience hopefully well get more in season 2we have one last question for you where would you most like to see 47 travel to in a future gameim not really too bothered about geographical location as much as the type of map i think that a prison complex would be really interesting to explore this could include areas like the prison cells facilities toilets showers laundary kitchens and so on hidden passages and tunnels warden and administrator offices and prison guard areas the default starting location could be outside the prison and you would need to breakin the main targets could be the king pin andor a corrupt wardenif theres anything else you want to say nows the timeid like to shout out a massive thanks to the entire team at ioi who have lovingly brought us hitman and continue to nurture this wonderful game i would also like to thank the hitman community for being so amazing especially all the friends that i have made they are the best most will go out their way to help and encourage others to become that perfect assassin yes we have our disagreements from time to time but ultimately its a fantastic community who all share the same love for the greatest game everthank you so much for your time euler13no thank you and the best of luck with everything that lies ahead",

    "text": "this year marks a milestone anniversary for us and its one that we want to celebrate ioi is 20 years oldweve been making games for two decades and have released 11 games from four different franchises it feels incredible to say that and look back at everything that weve achieved along the wayin 2000 we introduced agent 47 to the world with codename 47 and established his legacy as a silent assassin two years later then we released freedom fighters in 2003 and gave our take on an alternative history in new york before returning to 47 with the atmospheric hitman contracts and then blood money in 2006in the following three years we introduced another two franchises first kane amp lynch the worlds most notorious criminals blasted their way through two titles with the release of mini ninjas firmly placed between them after a 6year break agent 47 returned in hitman sniper challenge and absolution on new technology and with a very personal story now were still supporting hitman 2016 all caps with monthly content and love more than two years after its initial launchthats the entire release history of our games in two paragraphs we want to give each game a lot more love

incredible milestone last week we set a new alltime record for the most active users in a single day we had to spin up our server capacity to meet demandback in 2015 when we announced hitman we talked about building an expanding and evolving world of assassination these numbers prove to us that were pulling that off and were inspired to continue creating content that our players will want to play

    "text": "twenty eighteen is rolling by and were already into march about time for some curated contractsall curated contracts are chosen by a different member of the hitman community each month they cherry pick the best contracts on offer from other players and we publish them alongside the featured contracts for all players they say that you really get to know a person depending on the contracts that they curate lets find out if thats trueour curator for march is an oscarnominated directorproducer from toronto whose had some of his own contracts in the featured list before now hes on the other side of the fence are curating 10 contracts thatwill be live in the game on march 28 on all platformshello jetblackirishey guyscan you tell us a bit about who you arein the real world im a journalist and filmmaker as a journo ive written for a whole bunch of different newspapers and magazines mostly covering the entertainment industry as a filmmaker i wrote directed and produced the hbo film claude lanzmann spectres of the shoah and am in development now on my second movie and of course im also a longtime hitman fan going back to contractswhere can people findwatchfollow you onlinewell im on hitmanforum and youtube as jetblackiris or you can find the real me on twitter adambenzineyouve already had some of your own contracts featured which one are you most happy withi think id go with fall season preview it was my first to be featured it was challenging to a lot of players and it embraced my love of puns in the title you essentially had to push five targets to their death however some players found a way around that by koing targets and dumping them now that there is a no kos restriction perhaps i should remake ithow did you go about picking the contracts to be featured and how do you feel about your final choicesi wanted to be transparent about the process so i opened it up to players on hitmanforum for discussion i encouraged a conversation among players i made clear specifically what i was looking for a strong sniper contract a puzzle contract a fibrewire contract a loud and messy contract etc but i was also open to other players favourites im happy with the 10 ive chosen its quite hard to design contracts now because the maps and npc routes are very wellknown to players but these ones are all pretty great graduation from candidate to agent is a fantastic fibrewire contract on the ica facility map from a relative newcomer shooter is a great sniping contract dead presidents and backpack runners make smart use of littleobserved npc details which i love and bangkok ninja is a challenging puzzle finally and perhaps a little indulgently i dropped one of my own very special contracts into the mix as well which i hope agents will enjoyhow would you sum up your hitman playstyle are you all about speed stealth roleplaying or something else entirelydefinitely i prefer the roleplay aspect of it i grew up loving assassin movies such as the day of the jackal grosse point blank the bourne identity and the living daylights and as such i like to be immersed in the mission no disrespect to those who love speedrunning and there are plenty of players who do but to me it seems anathema to the whole notion of being a contract killer especially as that play style often involves running around and causing as much noise and chaos as you can to distract from the kill i prefer to be slow and methodical often on a user contract ill go back to get my suit at the end even though i dont need to simply because thats what 47 would dolooking back at the nowmorethantwoyears of hitman what single moment stands out for youi think when sapienza dropped everyones mind was kind of blown we were already impressed with the paris map but sapienza felt like an entire coastal seaside town and really demonstrated the possibilities of the game in a quite spectacular wayif thats the past lets look to the future what do you hope to see in agent 47s futures adventuresi like and support the episodic model it adds longevity to the game id love to see missions in london new york tokyo rio and las vegas three of the six maps from season one paris bangkok hokkaido were essentially single enclosed buildings so id like to see more open city maps with street crowds like sapienza and marrakesh i also hope for a few new inventive game modes beyond elusive targets and featured contractsalso this is kind of specific but id love to see a small mission set aboard a large commercial airplane with limited movement hiding spaces and weapon availability you could have restricted movement between economy class business class a first class upper deck and the pilot cabin but with plenty of poisoning and fibrewire kill possibilities i actually really liked some of those smaller interstitial missions and maps in absolutionif theres anything else you want to say the stage is yourscarrying a golf club through a fivestar hotel is suspicious but carrying a crowbar isnt really on a serious note you guys at ioi have done a great job with the game you really have there is nothing else out on the market like it you should be exceptionally proud roll on season twothanks jetblackiristhank you",

    "text": "on november 7 we released our game of the year edition of hitman and thought it would be fitting that the contract curator for november would be the creator whohas had the most featured contracts since the launch of the game until this point weve not been keeping track of exactly who was at the top of that leaderboardit was a close run thing decided by just one contract but we do have someone standing at the top of the pile the next contract curator is quinez theres a good chance that youve played one of his featured contracts already heres the list too many claudios blindness and sight cappin capns aquacadabra explosive secrets foretold sniper mario stay outside the fence plywood and paste and a crossed swords puzzlenow were ready to find out more about him and the contracts that hes chosen to be featured they went live in the game on november 30hello quinezhi im very pleased to be herecan you give us some intel on who you arei work in academia and my research is on emotional disorders and psychosis ive always been obsessed with puzzles and game mechanics hitman is a perfect sandbox for creating puzzles inside a really fun game so i quickly took to contract creationwhere can people findwatchfollow you onlinei post on hitman forum under the name quine i post on reddit under the name quinez and i also have a youtube channel where i occasionally post runsok lets really get to you know fibre wire or silverballersilverballer for sure fibre wire is classic but its onenote the silverballer lets you do cool tricks like shooting down chandeliers distracting bystanders with bullet holes or making tricky shots through windows that usually go unnoticed its the weapon of choice for the puzzleminded how did you go about choosing the 10 contractsi chose a mix of old contracts that have always stuck with me along with new contracts that use the new complications overall i wanted to showcase contracts that i think manifest excellent design decisions let me pick out a couple of the older contracts i chose and talk about why i think theyre noteworthyelite sniper church tower is one of my favorite sniper contracts to make a good sniper contract you need to find targets who can be sniped without the bodies being discovered and you need to encourage the player to do longrange shots this contract from bernardoone asks you to make some truly diabolical shots from sapienzas church tower the goty patch made some changes to sniping that makes this contract a lot easier than it used to be but the contract is still very satisfyingthe retroviral revengeance is simple and clean kill silvio and francesca while dressed in the hazmat suit its a perfect example of a roulette style contract that just adds extra objectives to a story mission these kinds of contracts can be really strong but the problem is in getting the objectives just right if theyre too restrictive then the mission becomes linear and boring but if theyre not restrictive enough then they just add a little busywork without really affecting the gameplay this is one that i think really works it changes how the level plays while still requiring thought and creativity nakar the creator even suggests a couple of optional bonus objectivesbonus poison both targets this includes regular poison the prototype virus sample and the hazardous gas in the containment roomsuper bonus never have line of sight to either targetyou mentioned the new contract complications that were recently added to contracts mode as youre the first curator to use them how much did that affect your choices for featured contractsim really excited about the new complications contract creators have wanted them for a long time and now we have them creators are still getting their feet wet exploring what the complications make possible but there are already some gems out there that ive chosen to feature urbens alley bully makes you hide bodies where there arent any obvious places to hide them coastercrafts easy at first glance asks you to sneak all throughout the hospital while dressed as a ninja blazingskys surgical precision makes you clear out a crowded surgery room without using any legshots beware security cameraslooking back at your own featured contracts which one do you think is the bestthis is a tough call its not the best contract lots of players hated it but the most fun i had was when blindness and sight was selected pros and speedrunners tore their hair out trying to figure out how to complete it with a silent assassin rating with many saying it was impossible eventually a 30 minute run was found and the time was then gradually whittled to 5 minutes players now understand the game too well for something like this to ever happen again i thinkforetold might be the best its simple in concept in marrakesh at night snipe the fortune teller in your suit its evocative and i think the briefing is especially strong the runs that emerged were fascinating the solution i intended is shown here by euler13 it requires making a blind shot through curtains after breaking the smoke machine with a breaching charge so that the fortuneteller cant turn it off thats something even the level designer didnt realize was possible but the contract inspired plenty of other mystifying and hilarious runsi like that stay outside the fence asks you to do something original and turns the game into a shooting gallery and i think sniper mario is a strong sniper contractweve also recently reactivated elusive targets is there one particular moment from an et that stands out for youprobably the bookkeeper one of my two failures at that point i had already unlocked all the suits so i decided to have some fun i tried to catch the target in the blast from sean roses watch bomb but i mistimed it and chaos ensuedelusive targets cause my hands to sweat and shake like nothing else theyre brilliantnow is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go have at itanother bit of fan creation i like to do is write up design documents for imaginary hitman levels ive written fantasy missions set at a swiss pharma company a north korean internment compound a hong kong shopping malland an icelandic whaling villageive also written up a bonus mission set in bangkokand a very speculative outline for what season 2 could look like please check them out thanks quinezthanks to you",

    "text": "it happenedthe sense of satisfaction at being able to write this is almost indescribableiointeractive announces its new game hitman today the newest venture for us agent 47 and every single dedicated wonderful fan of this franchise out there is about to begin if you somehow missed it heres the announcement trailer for you to enjoythe new game is simply called hitman we did this because in many ways this is the start of a new journey for hitman dont think of it as a reboot though think of it as a pure hitman experience and the foundation for future hitman games agent 47 is the aspirational assassin hes at the absolute peak of his power this time around this is our central promise a pure assassin fantasy so we liked the simplicity and the power of calling this game hitman we want him to be powerful and embody the fantasy completely and he will remain a constant throughout everything we do with the games going forwardso what is this new game well first off hitman is still a creative stealth action game featuring the greatest assassin out there agent 47 as an operative of the international contract agency his job is to take out highprofile targets all over the world supported by his longtime handler diana burnwood each location in the game is a living sandbox a place where every npc has a name and every room matters weve focused on making sure you the players have complete freedom of approach over how where and when you decide to take out your target creativity from players is fully expected you have the power and intelligence of agent 47 at your fingertips and it is your choice whether to use brute force or orchestrate a genuine masterpiece of assassinationlocations are more detailed more populated and much larger than ever before full of things to experiment with and targets to kill without any checkpoint systems in there contracts mode which well talk more about later in the year returns and really shines in these big sandboxes weve brought back save games so you can save your progress anywhere and we have revamped pretty much every system in our glacier engine to enable this hitman experience we promised you these things a while back and were sticking to them because they are important and because your feedback is important in fact its so important were taking things a step furthera live experienceone of the reasons why were calling this a new start for hitman is also the idea of releasing a digitally led product that can mean a lot of different things depending on who you are but for us it means were going to make hitman available first via direct downloadwere embracing what digital can offer a blockbuster game series like hitman it allows us to do things that are both bold and exciting and entirely new to the hitman experiencewe are building an expanding and evolving world of assassination the experience will begin on december 8th and we will release new locations missions and hits over time at regular intervals through 2016 which means well all be able to share in the excitement of a new content drop at the same time rather than unboxing a game playing it and then thats sort of it we want to deliver a true community experience creating an ongoing and evolving game which plays out with a finale that brings the story arc together our primary goal is to keep hitman players fully engaged so between bigger drops we will be creating oneoff live events and live targets to keep you immersed in the experienceimagine a target appearing for every player in the world for a limited time only lets say 48 hours where your one shot counts and when that target is gone it is gone forever a shared experience where we imagine the hitman community will come together every time a new mission or new location appears for 60 youll get full access to all of this content everything we release as part of this storyanother big part of this new approach is that we will develop the game with you the players and adjust gameplay and create live content and events based on player activity and feedback so the game will deepen and evolve as time progresses the experience begins on december 8th on playstation 4 xbox one and pc and will reach well into 2016exclusives and betaif you saw hitman revealed at the sony e3 press conference you heard the word exclusive a couple of times wed just quickly like to run through what that means playstation 4 will be the only console where you can experience the beta and where you can play it first a pc beta is planned to arrive a week later the beta is available for preorders now as for the playstation 4 exclusive contracts they are only available to those people who own a ps4 copy of the gameone more thingthe journey has just started for us all we are incredibly excited
