We recommend headphones and 4K quality for this one. Enjoy.\n\nAs Agent 47 embarks on the most important contracts of his career, you\u2019ll be in full control of his deadly abilities, razor-sharp instincts and entire arsenal of weapons and tools. You\u2019ll need them all to master the art of assassination.\nHITMAN 3\u2019s sandbox locations give you complete freedom to approach your objectives in any way you want. As well as the new multi-function camera, you\u2019ll also be able to interact with the game world in new ways to access new opportunities and paths through each level. Want to organise a meeting with your target? Check. How about opening elevator doors to access a new route? You can do that too and so much more.\nAs you explore each mission and complete challenges, you\u2019ll rise through 20 Mastery tracks that will unlock new tools, weapons and even Starting Locations that will let you begin your next playthrough with a big advantage \u2013 possibly even in a disguise. All of the items and weapons that you unlock in a Mastery track are added to your permanent inventory, so you\u2019ll be able to pick and choose from them no matter what mission you want to take on next.\nHITMAN 3 has been made with replayability front and centre. You simply cannot see and do everything that a mission has to offer in a single playthrough, and the Mastery tracks keep things fresh as you take new approaches, use new items and discover previously unexplored areas.\nDepending on how you choose to complete your objectives, you\u2019ll be awarded with a Playstyle at the end of each misson. From the coveted Silent Assassin to a Hired Gun and everything in between, there\u2019s a Hitman style for every player. Maybe you\u2019re a Marksman?\n\nOn next-gen consoles, HITMAN 3 will support 4K visuals, 60 fps and HDR with faster load times. We\u2019re also supporting the PS5\u2019s DualSense controller with some cool features and will launch with PS VR support, as we announced back in August. Details on how PS VR owners can play are listed in the DualSense blog too.\nIf you\u2019re not next-gen ready yet, we\u2019ve also get a next-gen upgrade program that allows a free upgrade when you make the jump between generations. Read more about that on the relevant store pages for you. PC players can check out our recent blog post for some specific details on the support we\u2019re bringing to that platform.\nWe\u2019re closing in on the launch of the game now, with just over a month to go until HITMAN 3 is in your hands. We\u2019re already lining up more reveals and getting ready to share more information between now and then. Exciting times ahead.\nWe\u2019ll leave you to prepare.\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPre-order Today\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPre-order now and secure the Trinity Pack, including three suits, three weapons and three briefcases \u2013 all themed to a game from the World of Assassination trilogy.\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/introducing-hitman-3-gameplay/"},
{"title": "HITMAN 3 on PC", "date": "December 7, 2020", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tLast month, we announced our partnership with Intel that would help us to provide the best possible performance and optimization for PC players in HITMAN 3.\nWe\u2019re excited to tell you more about how PC players will experience the game (in fewer than 47 days!) and share details about some of the features you can expect in January 2021 and beyond.\nOur Chief Technology Officer, Maurizio De Pascale, recently sat down with Intel Vice-President of Client XPU Product and Solutions, Roger Chandler, to talk about our partnership, the 20 year anniversary of Hitman and more.\nTogether with Intel, we are working to optimize the game for launch and beyond, with updates, tweaks and improvements coming throughout 2021 that will improve the experience of playing on a high-end PC and multi-core CPUs. Later in 2021, we will also implement Ray Tracing and look forward to sharing more on that next year.\nAt launch in January 2021, HITMAN 3\u2019s gameplay experience will be fluid and responsive thanks to improvements to interaction animation, where we\u2019ve tightened and optimized across the board. We\u2019ve also added improvements to lighting and reflections that allow us to fully realise the creative vision of where the game will take Agent 47.\nA perfect example of this is our recently-revealed Chongqing location, where 47 finds himself on the neon-lit rainy streets. Details such as water effects, rain hitting 47 and his clothes getting wet are all on full display. Take a look for yourself in our \u201cUnder The Hood\u201d trailer:\n\nOf course, HITMAN 3 will also support 4K visuals, HDR support and the option for an uncapped framerate. Today, we\u2019d also like to share more PC-specific details on some features that will be available on PC at launch, starting with directional reverb.\n\u201cDirectional reverb in HITMAN 3 makes the sound that is reflected off walls and obstacles feel like it\u2019s emanating from the general direction of the environment where the sound is located. This will improve a players ability to localize sound in a given space and makes the audio mix cleaner. Without this feature, the reverberated sound would seem to come from all around the player, which is not always accurate.\u201d \u2013 Senior Audio Programmer Stepan Boev\nAnd finally, we want to talk about and variable rate shading:\n\u201cVariable Rate Shading (VRS) is a new technique that allows us to change the shading rate dynamically. A higher shading rate means more visual fidelity at the expense of performance, while a lower shading rate means more performance at the expense of visual quality. By leveraging VRS, we can prioritize higher shading rates in areas of the frame where it will be more effective and reducing it in areas where it will be difficult to notice. Compared to using a lower resolution to increase framerate, VRS keeps the geometry edges sharp, effectively providing better performance while keeping visual quality high.\u201d \u2013 Senior Programmer Bernat Mu\u00f1oz Garcia\nStay tuned for more HITMAN 3 news coming your way before the end of the year.\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPre-Order HITMAN 3 today\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nPre-order the Deluxe or Standard Edition of HITMAN 3 and you\u2019ll get access to the Trinity Pack.\nGet direct links to digital and physical retailers on hitman.com\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-on-pc/"},

Welcome to Chongqing, China.\n\nThe rainy, neon-lit streets of Chongqing are full of shops and food stands, all crammed into narrow alleys and passageways \u2013 with plenty of secrets hidden off the beaten path. This Chinese transportation hub is the perfect destination for us to showcase just some of the refinements and improvements coming to the technology that powers HITMAN 3.\nHITMAN 3 is powered by IO Interactive\u2019s proprietary Glacier engine and will look, sound and play better than ever with improvements to lighting, reflections, animation and AI. Chongqing also features full water effects with details such as rain drops hitting Agent 47 and his clothes getting wet, all adding to the immersion of experiencing HITMAN 3.\nOn next-gen consoles, HITMAN 3 will run in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second with HDR support. Our new \u2018Under The Hood\u2019 trailer also showcases smooth gameplay moments captured in Chongqing that show off the refinements to interaction animation and AI. In other locations, such as Dubai, Glacier\u2019s crowd technology will allow up to 300 active NPC\u2019s in a location at once.\nHITMAN 3 players can import locations from the previous games in the trilogy and have more than 20+ locations under one roof. All of the improvements to rendering, animation and AI introduced with HITMAN 3 can be enjoyed across all three games, making HITMAN 3 the ultimate place to play the entire World of Assassination trilogy.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPre-order HITMAN 3\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPre-order HITMAN 3 now and get access to the Trinity Pack and choose from the Standard or Deluxe Edition!

We\u2019re also introducing Variable Rate Shading (VRS), a technique that allows us to prioritize GPU resources where they have the biggest impact. On top of that, we will also implement Ray Tracing after the launch of the game, later in 2021.\nWe\u2019re excited to continue our partnership with Intel and look forward to sharing more details of what PC players can look forward to with HITMAN 3.\n\nThis month, we are also celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Hitman franchise and the release of Codename 47. Back in 2000, Agent 47\u2019s journey began and it\u2019s a significant moment for us as a studio to reach this milestone. Codename 47 was one of the most technologically advanced games for its time, with techniques for ragdoll physics and animation that were on the cutting edge of what was possible. The roots of IOI lie deep within developing technology, and we continue to create our games on our own proprietary Glacier engine. That\u2019s just as true today as it was back then.\nStay tuned for more HITMAN 3 announcements coming this month, and remember to share your #Hitman20Years moments with us on social media to be part of celebrating two decades of Agent 47.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/ioi-intel-hitman3/"},

As part of our preparations, we\u2019ve put together some useful information for new players on what to expect.\nThe entire World of Assassination trilogy will be available on Stadia. HITMAN 1 and HITMAN 2 will both be available starting from September 1st and HITMAN 3 will be available on 20 January 2021 to complete the trilogy.\nAs we are able to have all of the games seamlessly in one place for the first time, you\u2019ll always launch HITMAN games on Stadia through HITMAN: World of Assassination. This is your hub for all things HITMAN on Stadia. It\u2019s where you\u2019ll go to play HITMAN 1 and HITMAN 2 and also HITMAN 3 when in launches.\n\nHITMAN: World of Assassination will be your destination whether you redeem HITMAN 1, which is available free in Stadia Pro, or you purchase HITMAN 2. When you launch the game, the menu and UI will be in HITMAN 2\u2019s visual style.\nYou\u2019ll also get access to the ICA Facility location from HITMAN 1 and the Hawke\u2019s Bay location from HITMAN 2 regardless of which game you own. For example, if you are a Stadia Pro subscriber and redeem HITMAN 1, you\u2019ll also get access to Hawke\u2019s Bay and see how HITMAN 2 continues the campaign. In terms of game modes, Contracts Mode, Escalations and solo Sniper Assassin will be available, but Ghost Mode and Sniper Assassin co-op will not be featured.\nWhen HITMAN 3 launches on 20 January 2021, we\u2019ll update HITMAN: World of Assassination to include the design changes of HITMAN 3. If you can\u2019t wait until January, we\u2019ve lined up some unique item variants for Stadia players that are unlocked simply by playing each game from the Trilogy. Here\u2019s how that breaks down:\n\nPlay HITMAN 1 to unlock the Sunset Rubber Duck, a remote rubber duck explosive.\nPlay HITMAN 2 to unlock the Orange Pinstripe Briefcase, the perfect place to hide your new rubber duck explosive.\nPlay HITMAN 3 to unlock the White Sunset Suit, which is certain to impress at any formal gathering.\n\nWatch our Stadia Announcement Trailer to see Agent 47 using the rubber duck and briefcase in Dubai. In the trailer, you\u2019ll see Agent 47 wearing the default starting suit for Dubai \u2013 and not the White Sunset Suit. As that\u2019s a HITMAN 3 unlock, we\u2019re saving it for a little bit later.\n\nAs a studio, it\u2019s exciting for us to see HITMAN: World of Assassination launch and have a single place for all three games to be playable seamlessly in one place. Follow us on social media for updates and news on HITMAN: World of Assassination and HITMAN 3.\nAs one final note, Stadia pre-orders for HITMAN 3 will be available soon.

{"title": "HITMAN 3 \u2013 Dartmoor", "date": "August 20, 2020", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDiscover the secrets of an old manor and uncover clues to solve the Thornbridge Mystery. Welcome to Dartmoor \u2013 a new location coming to HITMAN 3.\n\nDARTMOOR\nWe\u2019ve shown you Dubai. Now it\u2019s time for Dartmoor.\nHITMAN 3\u2019s second mission location takes you to a historical part of England known for its grassy meadows, rocky hilltops, winding rivers and dense wetlands. Dartmoor also has a reputation for myths, legends and mysteries \u2013 and Thornbridge Manor lives up to that!\nThe Thornbridge Mystery trailer focuses on just one of the Mission Stories available to players in Dartmoor. Besides playing detective and piecing the mystery together, you\u2019ll have full freedom to explore and create your own plans. Today, we\u2019re focusing on the \u2018murder mystery\u2019 element of the mission because it\u2019s unique and something we\u2019ve always thought about doing \u2018one day\u2019. We\u2019ve even talked about HITMAN games as a \u2018reverse murder mystery\u2019 in the past. Typically, a murder mystery tasks you with figuring out how someone has died, whereas in Hitman, you need to figure out how to kill someone. In HITMAN 3\u2019s Dartmoor location, those worlds collide as you can take on the role of detective to solve a murder and eliminate your target. Two birds, one disguise.\n\n\nAt the IOI Copenhagen office, we have a whiteboard dedicated to this mission. It\u2019s sat near our writers and is full of post-its, scribbles and pieces of string that connect different pieces of information. It\u2019s got way too many spoilers on it, so we can\u2019t share it here but we\u2019ll save some photos for another day. For a visual reference, think of the the wall you see at the end of the Colorado mission in HITMAN 1. This one.\n\nTo tell you more about what it\u2019s like working on the Dartmoor location, here\u2019s Nick Price, Lead Writer on HITMAN 3:\n\u201cHITMAN missions are very complicated affairs with plenty of moving parts and lots of characters you are able to interact with in a huge variety of ways. In Dartmoor\u2019s murder mystery, we are dialing all of that up to 11. \nEvery member of the family is a possible suspect and it\u2019s been quite the challenge to make sure everything doesn\u2019t fall apart just because the player wants to play around. In fact, that sort of behaviour should be rewarded in a HITMAN game, so we have been working hard on making sure that depending on what a player discovers during their investigation, outcomes might differ. It\u2019s going to be great fun to see how everyone tackles this particular problem next year.\u201d\n\n\nPRE-ORDERS\nHITMAN 3 pre-orders are scheduled to go live later this month and we\u2019re pleased to have an updated line-up of platforms. In January 2021, you\u2019ll be able to play HITMAN 3 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Google Stadia and PC, where the game will be available exclusively via Epic Games Store for 12 months.\nAs an independent studio, our partnership with Epic has given us the freedom to create HITMAN 3 exactly as we imagined and self-publish the game to our players directly. It\u2019s also important to us that we honour the time our existing PC players have spent in our previous games.\nWith that in mind, we are pleased to confirm that PC players will be able to carryover their current progression and unlocks from HITMAN 2 on Steam into HITMAN 3 on Epic Games Store. It will also be possible for PC players to import locations from the previous two games into HITMAN 3 on Epic Games Store. We want to make it a seamless process for our PC players to enjoy HITMAN 3 on a different PC platform and continue to enjoy the benefits of our World of Assassination.\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-england/"},

We\u2019ve been working on this for a while and now we\u2019re ready to share the first details of what to expect when you virtually step into Agent 47\u2019s world. Take a look at HITMAN 3 in VR right now with our latest trailer:\n\nHITMAN 3 will support PlayStation VR at launch in January 2021 \u2013 but it\u2019s not only HITMAN 3 locations that are supported. Every location from the World of Assassination trilogy can be enjoyed in VR.\nWe\u2019re talking more than 20+ locations across all three games that can be explored and experienced in an entirely new way. As a reminder, we revealed in the HITMAN 3 Announcement that it will be possible to \u2018import\u2019 locations that you own from the previous two HITMAN games into HITMAN 3. You\u2019ll need to launch locations from HITMAN 3 to play them in VR. We\u2019re working to finalize the specifics for how PSVR owners can enjoy HITMAN in VR, and we\u2019ll have more details to share in the months ahead.\nWhether you\u2019re in the mood to dress as Helmut Kruger and walk the catwalk in Paris, infiltrate a bank vault in New York, or even if you just want to relax and listen to the waves gently crashing on the beaches of Sapienza \u2013 you can do it all in VR!\nPlaying in VR will literally change the way you play with a first-person perspective that lets you immerse yourself into the game world. Stand face-to-face with your targets, blend-in to a busy crowd to overhear conversations and interact with the game world using your hands. For example, imagine that you\u2019ve picked up a frying pan and you sneak up on a guard. You can swing the frying pan in whatever angle you want to knock them out \u2013 and then use it to deflect bullets that are fired as you make your escape.\nHITMAN VR will immerse you into the World of Assassination in a unique way and we can\u2019t wait to see the creative ideas and playthroughs our creative community can come up with when they get their hands on the game in January next year. We\u2019re already looking forward to sharing more details about our VR support for HITMAN 3!\n\u00a0\nUPDATE: August 13, 2020\nWe\u2019re excited to share more insights into HITMAN 3\u2019s VR support and talk about what you can expect from this new way to play the game.\nOur second \u2018Developer Insights\u2019 video is called\u00a0Become the Hitman\u00a0and features various members of the IO Interactive team talking about HITMAN VR and what went into making it.

It makes us smile just reading that out loud. Here\u2019s the brand new Announcement Trailer for you to enjoy.\n\nHITMAN 3 is the dramatic conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy and takes players around the world on a globetrotting adventure to sprawling sandbox locations. Agent 47 returns as a ruthless professional for the most important contracts of his entire career.\nSupported by his Agency handler, Diana Burnwood, 47 joins forces with his long-lost friend Lucas Grey. Their ultimate mission is to eliminate the partners of Providence, but they are forced to adapt as their hunt intensifies. When the dust settles, 47 and the world he inhabits will never be the same again.\nHITMAN 3 will be available on 20 January 2021 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Google Stadia and PC. Death Awaits.\n\nHITMAN 3 will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, playable via cloud streaming technology. A stable and permanent internet connection is required to play.\nTop of the World\nLet\u2019s talk locations. Every mission location in HITMAN 3 is meticulously detailed and packed full of creative opportunities. We\u2019ve made sure that players will have unrivalled freedom to complete their objectives and the game world will react to everything they do. All of this is made possible by our award-winning Glacier technology, which powers HITMAN 3\u2019s immersive game world to offer unparalleled player choice and replayability.\nWhen HITMAN 3 is released in January 2021, the entire campaign will be available to play, from the breathtaking start to the dramatic ending. Today, we\u2019re unveiling the first of six locations that will be featured in the game. We start with Agent 47 literally on top of the world. Welcome to Dubai.\nOur Dubai: Cinematic Gameplay Trailer gives you a first look at our new game in motion. Everything was captured in-engine using some creative camera angles. We look forward to sharing a true, hands-on gameplay trailer in the coming weeks.\n\nA Platform of Assassination\nThe World of Assassination trilogy is fully realised with HITMAN 3 and we are establishing our new game as the ultimate place to play all three games. Players of our previous HITMAN games will be pleased to know that it will be possible to \u2018import\u2019 locations that they own from the previous two HITMAN games into HITMAN 3, essentially putting all 20+ locations from the entire trilogy in one place.\nPlaying the entire trilogy from beginning to end, from within HITMAN 3, also means that the progression systems in HITMAN 3 work across all locations. You can unlock an item in Dubai and take it with you to Paris, for example. Now that we\u2019re talking about items and progression, we\u2019re pleased to say that HITMAN 2 players will have the option to carry over their hard-earned unlocks and progression into HITMAN 3. This is something that players have been asking for and we\u2019re delighted to confirm.\nHITMAN 3 will act as a platform for the entire trilogy, and we are excited to finally realise a vision that we had five years ago; to create a game world that would continually grow and expand over time. In the coming months, we\u2019ll share precise details about how location and progression carryover will work.\n\nIO Independent\nHITMAN 3 will be developed and published by IO Interactive. It feels like a natural step for HITMAN 3, as the final game in this trilogy, to come directly from us to our players. We feel ready for the challenge and look forward to embracing the journey, together with our players and community.\nThere\u2019s something special about HITMAN 3 being the first full game that we self-publish. Everyone at IOI, in both our Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6 offices, is ready to deliver a Hitman game that we are all extremely proud of.\nOne final thing; now that we\u2019re the developer and publisher, we\u2019re debating whether to include the IOI logo twice on the HITMAN 3 boot screen. We\u2019ll keep you all informed on what we decide!\n\nMore Soon\u2026\nWe know you have questions and you want to know more. The good news is that this is just the start of our conversation about HITMAN 3. We\u2019ve got a lot more to say about our new gameplay features and systems, more locations to reveal and some other big surprises too! Over the coming months, we\u2019ll be publishing blog posts and hosting livestreams to keep you up to speed.\nFor now, we invite you to take a look at the newly refreshed hitman.com. All the key information about HITMAN 3 is already there and we\u2019ve also got you covered with various wallpapers for your devices in glorious 4K. The site will be updated as we reveal and announce more throughout the year.\nIf you can\u2019t wait and want all the HITMAN 3 updates and IOI news delivered directly to your inbox, sign up for an IOI Account and tick all the newsletter boxes.

{"title": "Curated Contracts: Chaos_Agent_45", "date": "June 10, 2020", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe June Contract Curator is locked and ready. He is a well-known figure on Hitman Forum, and is known for many things, but primarily one \u2013 SNIPING. CHAOS_AGENT_45 has some serious skills when it comes to a long-range rifle. Demonstrating this to the fullest when he won the Sniper Assassin Competition on PS4. Now it\u2019s time to get closer, to the man in the nest:\n\n\nHi CHAOS_AGENT_45! Nice to meet you.\nNice to meet you too, this is a huge honor to me\n\nCan you share with us some intel on who you are?\nI\u2019m Daniele from Germany,\u00a0 also known as CHAOS_AGENT_45. Playing on PS4.\u00a0 I\u2019m a passionate and experienced Hitman player with a focus on sniping, speed runs and creative, unique strategies.\nIs there a place people can people find/watch/follow you online?\nYou can find me on YouTube,\u00a0 Twitch and on HitmanForum as CHAOS_AGENT_45.\nAwesome, now let\u2019s talk Hitman. When did you first stumble upon the Bald Assassin?\nIn the Summer 2016. My neighbor bought HITMAN 2016 when Marrakesh was released. While he was buying some drinks and snacks, he let me play. I was just causing massive chaos at the consulate riot and threw proxy ducks at the crowd. When my neighbor came back, he said: \u201cPlay it serious or let it go\u201d. 4 months later I bought a PS4 and the game. This is where it all started. And that\u2019s also the reason for \u201cChaos Agent\u201d.\n\nThe Origin Story of your name, amazing! CHAOS_AGENT_45 \u2013 Tell us \u2013 why is Sniping so awesome? \ud83d\ude0a\nMay I answer this with a little quad kill video?\n\nPoint taken! Can you share your most impressive Sniping move to date?\nThe most impressive sniping I did are defiantly these two:\nThe moving double headshot + hideing both bodies (Maison and a Bodyguard) on the roof In Himmelstein. (Also my Sniper Assassin Contest Winner Run). You wouldn\u2019t believe how much time and training that one took. The time window is so minimal, every shot has to be clockwork precise.\n\nThe triple Sniper head-shot in the Miami escalation \u201cThe Riviera Restoration Level 3\u201d. One of the most difficult multi-kills I\u2019ve tried. I saw the possibility and after hours\u00a0 \u2013 I had all the puzzle pieces together.\n\n\u00a0\nYou got some serious skills. Let\u2019s store the rifle for a second, and talk more about the games. What is your favorite Hitman game, and why?\nI played Hitman: Blood Money, HITMAN 2016 and HITMAN 2. But my favorite is defiantly HITMAN 2 in its current state. Sniping is at its best, and most powerful. I love the different Sniper Rifle types and their possibilities. We have two silenced one shot killing ,penetrative sniper rifles, that is something I have been wising for, for a long time.\nYour favorite is HITMAN 2, what\u2019s your favorite map(s) from that game?\nDefiantly Miami &amp; Isle of Sg\u00e0il.\nSo HITMAN 3 is announced! What did you think of the reveal and what are you looking forward to the most for this last chapter of the trilogy?\nI\u2019m very happy and excited. I love this game and can\u2019t wait to explore and learn new maps, triggers and NPC cycles + New maps and items, sniping and 1000+ hours of satisfying gameplay.\nGreat! Talking overall HITMAN \u2013 What\u2019s your favorite moment in HITMAN? Can be anything, from in-game to something you\u2019ve seen, played etc.\nWhen I finally got the strategy to work. The strategy that I used for the Sniper Assassin contest. My hands were shaking, and I was so relieved to finally proof what was possible.\nAnd you did indeed pull it off \u2013 how was to see yourself as an NPC In game?\nIt\u2019s very funny and a huge honor. I still cannot believe how good your artists are. It\u2019s really how I look in real life. Spot on.\n\n\nNOW \u2013 Contracts time!\nHow did you go about choosing/creating/ finding the 11 contracts, what was your process?\nI played 98 contracts and created over 20 contracts to test and try them. I looked through the whole Contracts thread on Hitman forum for HITMAN 2016 and HITMAN 2, and looked through my played contracts history, and favorites. My goal was a mix of freedom contracts, zero mastery needed (except for IT\u2019S TOO EARLY),a fiber wire contract, a pistol contract and as much \u201cany method\u201d as possible and less complications as possible. It should be a batch that can be played with every skill level and play style. Half legacy/half current maps.\nSounds like an awesome mix, with good a variety too! Please tell us about some of the contracts you\u2019ve chosen/ created and why you chose them.\nI know that Colorado is not very popular, but Get a Leg up offers two things: The Pointman is the only disguise in the whole game that can openly carry a sniper rifle, and with that, you can be very creative in this contract. You can do it your way.\nLittle Shop of Horrors is a contract from HITMAN 2016, and was memorable for me. It\u2019s a pretty \u201ceasy\u201d but enjoyable SONKO contract.\nFeature Dream is a contract by one of the most experienced and talented but underrated contract creators on PS4. White-Half is a player from japan. He created thousands of contracts and the most difficult puzzle contracts I ever played. He is always an inspiration for me as a HITMAN player.\nAwesome Chaos, now let\u2019s go a little behind the screens here:\nWhat is the one item you always take into a contract with you, and why do you like it so much (I think I already know the answer here) ?\nThe ICA EXECUTIVE BRIEFCASE MK II filled with a Sniper Rifle. Why? I think this video will give you a clear answer:\n\nMessage received! If you have to be \u201cin general\u201d here, then what makes Contracts Mode so special for you?\nIt focuses on all the great opportunities beside the main missions. There is so much to explore and combine. It\u2019s like a huge box of Lego, and you can built whatever you want.\nGreat answer. So if it exists, what makes the perfect Contract?\nAn \u201cAny/Any\u201d contract with 3-5 targets and no complications, a mix of different NPC types, and space for creativity \u2013 and unique approaches.\nOkay I have one last question for you: Favorite\u00a0Sniper Rifle:\nJaeger7 Lancer\u00a0 #LancerOrRito\n\nIt\u2019s also a killer. Okay, now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. Have at it Chaos!\nA big thanks to my inspirations (mentioned in the briefing of BATCH OF CHAOS), check out Frote\u2019s Speedrun community and hitmanforum for friendly players. I really hope that HandsOfBlood (my favorite German HITMAN streamer) will play one the contracts.

{"title": "Curated Contracts: Urben", "date": "May 21, 2020", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe May Contract Curator is here and ready. He\u2019s a well-known figure and Mod on Hitman Forum and Discord. He\u2019s a very creative soul and often creates humorous, mind puzzling contracts and shares hilarious and complex videos. This also results in some very interesting ways to take out Elusive Targets. You can play his 11 Curated Contracts now in HITMAN 2.\nBut now, let\u2019s take some time and get to know him a bit better, and find out more about where he gets his crazy ideas from:\n\nUrben! Nice to meet you.\nHey! Glad to be here!\nCan you give us some intel on who you are?\nYou already summarized me well for what I do at HITMAN so let me add something more personal:\nI\u2019m from Germany and currently try to find my place in the software industry. I am an analytic, yet also a creative mind who likes to put that into use not only in gaming but also programming. Let\u2019s see where this leads me to.\nI am eagerly using the Internet to find inspiring things, interesting people and also use it to learn. I do that since I was a kid which made me appreciate the value of the digital sphere. Because of that I am also involved in some political activities when I see this space in danger. I also try to inform others from time to time as you can easily miss these things.\nIf people want to see more of what you do, where can they watch/follow you online?\nI am most active on Hitmanforum but also on Discord like the Official Hitman one or the Discord of Frote7\u2019s Speedrun Community. You can find all my creative videos on my Youtube Channel.\nGreat! Now let\u2019s go back in time: when did you first stumble upon the Bald Assassin?\nMy first HITMAN\u00a0 game was Blood Money. I did not play it as much as the recent games, but I played through it multiple times with joy. The level I remember the most is \u201cYou Better Watch Out\u2026\u201d. Vertical maps are always special and I love to climb or sneak my way to an advantage point and pull off kills from multiple levels below or above.\n\nIt\u2019s also a classic! But let\u2019s circle in on the games, what is your favorite Hitman game, and why?\nThe current ones by far with HITMAN 2 taking the lead. I think the formula was there quite much in older HITMAN games, but with all these ways to interact, multiple starting/exit locations, pickup locations, items and so on\u2026 I can only say this is a huge lethal holiday simulator sandbox that I cannot imagine to find in any other franchise.\nSo keeping it around HITMAN 2, what is your favourite map ?\nEveryone saying it is Sapienza is boring, so I go with Isle of Sg\u00e0il. While it feels a bit too much as the fortress it actually is, I already said I love vertical maps and this surely is one of them. And the atmosphere is just beautiful.\n\nNow we\u2019ve talked about your favourite game and map, but what in general has been your favourite moment, in HITMAN? Can be anything, from in-game to something you\u2019ve seen, played etc.\nHard to say as I did and saw so much. It almost became regular business. But what really stood out was being invited to the Gamescom to meet you and some cool players from the community to test the upcoming HITMAN 2. It even topped having the studio creative director of IO talking about one of my videos as one of the most creative kills that he has seen so far, right there at the E3. I still wait for my medal by the way. \ud83d\ude09\nAlso, finding myself in Haven was very special.\nFinding once self is always special! \u2013 So Urben \u2013 You create many awesome videos for HITMAN, if you should point out one of your personal best \u2013 which one is it? \ud83d\ude0a\nIt is the Weaponized Parrot Kill on the Revolutionary. It is not only about the idea but also the presentation. And I think I reached a peak with both of them there.\nAn older one that is also nice to watch is The 250,000,000 Pound Sterling Big One Throw where I throw the Big One on a propane flask. The explosion accelerates it to another flask where the target stands. The music, the slow motion and the fact the target must see the Big One coming for him nails it.\nComplexity seems to be a theme here, what\u2019s the most complex thing you\u2019ve done in HITMAN?\nThere are many complicated things I did. I know you want my answers to be short but you literally ask for it with this one!\nI did this sniper double kill in World of Tomorrow. The same bullet kills Franny and later Silvio in his plane. (At 7:30min in the video) The shot was very hard to do as the travel time of the bullet made it impossible to guess when to shoot. I always missed the plane so I had to apply some science!\nWhat I did was pausing the game when his plane was where I want to hit it and made a screenshot of the map so I have his position. Then I looked for a place for 47 on the map to shoot a not-moving object that is equally far away. There I did a test shot on the object, also in slow motion, recorded it, went to my video editor and measured the time from trigger to impact. I applied the same time to a recording of the actual point of view of the kill to see where Caruso has to be on my screen to hit the trigger.\nBut there was another problem: I did not find an object to shoot at for the test, even from edge-to-edge the map was too small for that distance. So instead I shot at a bell of the boat that is related to the Kraken Easter Egg. But that one is not marked on the map! How do I find out it\u2019s position?\nI aimed on the bell from multiple positions on the map so I could use the direction indicator of 47\u2019s position symbol on the map to draw the lines of sight. Where the lines crossed was the position of the bell on the map. With that knowledge I found out that shooting the boat\u2019s bell from the church\u2019s bell (oh the irony) is pretty much the very same distance I was looking for. The rest was the described math with my video editor.\n\nNOW \u2013 Contracts time!\nShare with us howd you went about choosing/creating/ finding the 11 contracts, what was your process?\nI began collecting contracts way before you asked me as I am slow at this. I had a short list of people that are quite creative so I tried to include a contract from each of them. But that was not enough. So I went through the HITMAN 2 contract thread on HMF. Yes, all 3k posts. But I still had not enough! So I reinstalled HITMAN 2016 and went through the contract thread for this game. Yes, all 10k posts. Luckily this way I could also include other creative people that are less active these days. That also made up for me turning down the offer to become the last HITMAN 2016 curator.\nI also tweaked some contracts, labelled as REMIX. I want that to be understood as a collaboration, a new concept that makes the batch more special. Not as some attempt to fix something. I wanted the cool ideas to fit better in what I tried to accomplish with this batch.\nLegacy, Remix and Mashup \u2013 this is awesome! Your 11 picks are now playable in HITMAN 2, can you tell us about the contracts you\u2019ve chosen/ created and why you chose them.\nEvery contract offers multiple solutions. For example in \u201cThe Accidental Gardener\u201c (Santa Fortuna by Kent) you can either infiltrate the tunnels or set up traps when starting there undercover.\nEvery contract can also be speedrun, which means there is always a way to spend time usefully. \u201cBookend Beauties\u201d (Paris by Euler13) kind of requires you to not waste too much time as you cannot KO the targets and need to keep them isolated before returning with the required axes.\nStill every contract should be enjoyable if you take your time. You don\u2019t even need Mastery for any of them\u2026 in theory.\nAlthough, I could not resist to include a narrower contract that really tests your creativity: \u201cPerfect Shooter Puzzle\u201d (Miami by WhiteHalf).\nAnd as a finish, you get to\u2026 uh meet me in Haven in another tricky contract I made myself. Please be gentle~!\n\nLet us go a little behind the screen here:\nPreparation is key. What is the one item you always take into a contract with you and why do you like it so much?\nI often have my pre-set loadout contain stuff from my last Elusive Target, so I happen to start contracts often with the Big One or Laser Tripwire in my pockets. I am more than happy if I am able to make use of them in the most obscure ways.\nHaha Laser Tripwire in pockets \u2013 you play a dangerous game Urben! If you should sum up: What makes Contracts so special for you?\nThe maps, the tools and the ways to combine them is my main enjoyment in these games. I loved Lego as a kid and I kind of do the same here now. Please keep on making unique pieces I can put together!\nIf it exists, What makes the perfect Contract?\nThe perfect contract offers a puzzle to solve. And a way to bypass it with more effort if you don\u2019t like that. It can also be done fast, but does not push you if you don\u2019t want to. It limits you to become creative, but is still open enough if you want to do things your way. And you come back to it because after finishing it you have new ideas, new knowledge you want to try out.\nWhat I personally try is to wrap that up in an appearance that makes the contract look easier than it is. According to Munga I am successful at this.\nWe\u2019re almost at the end Urben, so now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. Have at it!\nIf you like contracts and missed out my featured ones in HITMAN 2016, you are in luck! With the help of MulletPride the best of them are ready to be played on all platforms.\nOr if you want to get into contract creation yourself, let me help you with this huge guide that contains many tips about what makes a generally enjoyable contract. Join us whenever Clemens is asking for submissions for Featured Contracts!\nAnd finally I thank all people who follow my videos and leave comments, even to old ones. It wouldn\u2019t be half the fun if I could not share them with you! This community in general is very positive, it is nice to be part of it!\nThank you Urben, and thanks for giving us and the community the opportunity to get to know you a bit better !\nThank you as well! What could I want more?\nNo seriously, where is my medal?\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/curated-contracts-urben/"},

He\u2019s a well-known figure on Hitman Forum and Reddit. His 11 Curated Contracts are live now in HITMAN 2.\nHe\u2019s a very creative soul and often creates humorous, mind puzzling contracts and shares stylish screenshots. But now, let\u2019s take some time and get to know him a bit better, and find out more about where he gets his contracts passion:\n\nKevinRudd! Nice to meet you.\nG\u2019day, mate!\nCan you give us some intel on who you are?\nSome may think of me as a former Prime Minister (j/k \u2013 or am I?), but to the rest of the HITMAN community, I\u2019m that guy who keeps coming up with a buttload of contracts (First the Sniper series, now all sorts of interesting types) and posting them on Reddit and HitmanForum. I\u2019m also that guy who keeps posting Ansel pictures on Reddit from the game. I like to think I have other contributions too.\nWe do remember your awesome sniper contracts quite well! \u2013 Where can people find/watch/follow you online?\nYou can find me as u/alban3se on Reddit where I\u2019ve been posting something every single night this year, apart from a brief holiday, and as KevinRudd on HMF where I\u2019m active in the contract, Ansel (picture) and other threads of people trying to get the most out of the game.\nAnd we\u2019ll get back to your Ansel skills later on, but first: When did you first stumble upon the Bald Assassin?\nThe first time I played a Hitman game was in either 2002 or 2003, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin at my brother\u2019s house. Ever since then I was hooked!\n\nWe all are \ud83d\ude09 Can you tell us what Hitman game is your favorite, and why?\nWould have to be the current game (HITMAN 2) with all DLC, truly a world of assassination; there\u2019s always a reason to come back to each location; you\u2019re not confined to just one mission, take advantage of the big maps and world that\u2019s been crafted!\nExcellent point, so talking about HITMAN 2, what\u2019s your favourite location?\nI have to mention that Sapienza is the best location in the franchise of all time, soz but it\u2019s true. But for HITMAN 2\u2026 maybe Miami. Big and civilian-oriented are my favourite. New York is very polished and has nice music though, and Haven Island is a bit of fun. But the real question is when are we getting an Australia map?\nWell, New Zealand is \u201crelatively\u201d close to Australia, wouldn\u2019t you say? Anyways! \u2013\u00a0 what\u2019s your favourite moment, in HITMAN? Can be anything, from in-game to something you\u2019ve seen, played etc.\nBeing picked as a Curator is pretty cool, almost as cool as winning an election. But I enjoyed the challenge of coming up with a sniper contract for every single map in the game; can\u2019t wait to do it for H3\u2019s levels, whatever they are.\nHint hint, developers, make sure every map has cool sniping spots \ud83d\ude09\nQuite an awesome collection of Sniper Contracts, and awesome pictures for them as well, tell us a bit about Where you draw your Ansel inspiration?\nIf I wasn\u2019t a Prime Minister in this life (Not saying I\u2019m not, but hypothetically if I wasn\u2019t); then you could say I studied film and television and have a strong interest in that stuff. So I know a bit about composing a shot with a real camera, and if you get the Ansel Unlocked cheat on PC then it functions a lot like a real camera can (Except it floats magically in the air, so much better than real camera). There are some cool settings, interesting characters and humorous happenings to get shots of in this game, oh yeah and some of the glitches are funny too \ud83d\ude09\n\n\nNOW \u2013 Let\u2019s talk Contracts!\nLet\u2019s start by talking about your Curator Batch. How did you go about choosing/creating/ finding the 10 / 11 contracts, what was your process?\nI used detailed programmatic specificity and weeks of replaying old contracts (Thanks, COVID-19!) to come up with the final list.\nIf this batch has a theme, it\u2019d be \u2018variety\u2018; I wanted to choose contracts that covered every single aspect of this vast game (If that\u2019s even possible), and I tried to spread it across as many maps as possible. Essentially all of these contracts come from the HitmanForum contract thread, it\u2019s really the only place to go if you\u2019re after contracts that aren\u2019t killing the gate guard in the tutorial map. I also like contracts that have a premise to them beyond \u2018 just kill these people lel\u2019.\nI\u2019ve made it my mission to come up with a variety of contract types the past year, so I\u2019ve also gone through my own to find ones which aren\u2019t a very common category; the rest are from those who have their own types they\u2019re good at making.\nWith the theme of variety in mind, some of the categories you\u2019ll find in this batch are: Infiltration, Puzzle, Sniper, Loud Gun, Freedom, Speedrun, Explosive, Non-Assassination Skills and Challenge. I don\u2019t like elaborate restrictive contracts, although I put in one that sort of comes close for people who really want to be challenged.\nI want the less adventurous players out there who haven\u2019t given certain styles or types a shot to see this batch, play it and go \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t done that before but I like it\u201d and maybe even learn something new about how things in the game work.\nBrilliant idea and variety as a theme is great!\n\n\nWe thought it would be cool to use KevenRudd\u2019s Ansel skills, so we asked him to take a picture for his Contracts and write a little teaser for each:\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tI Never Wear A RubberWill you overcome breathing problems and make a lot of noise?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhich color has your collar?\nIs it better to be a janitor who looks up to bankers, or a banker who looks down on janitors?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat\u2019s That Sound?\nIf a bomb goes off in the suburbs and no one is alive to hear it, does it make a sound?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tKnockout!\nHow do you feel about taking dead people\u2019s clothes?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSniper Assassin: Castle Mk II\nCan you be a silent assassin from a single rooftop?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHokkaido Fastball\nHow do you get around dressed like THAT?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGrand Theft Bosco\n[Redacted]\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tArrive, Hide, Leave\nCan you solve a puzzle without fancy gadgets?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWildcard\nRelax and just have fun with this one\n\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tEviction\nCan you fulfil all the conditions?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tRipe For The Picking\nCan you figure out the secrets of the vents, or will you do things the old fashioned way?\n\n\u00a0\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tNow \u2013 Let\u2019s go a bit behind the screens here:\nWhat is the one item you always take into a contract with you and why do you like it so much?\nThere isn\u2019t any one item I take in with me every time, as I play a lot of puzzle contracts in which you have to figure out very specific items to bring; but 95% of the time I take at least either the Silverballer/Krugermeier or Sieker; silenced pistol is good for everything\u2026 kills, distractions, causing a panic, destroying cameras, and the Sieker is useful for getting people out of the way peacefully, but mainly is funny\nThe Silverballer, classic move Mr. Rudd. Please share with us what makes Contracts special for you?\nAny game that lets its players come up with content is good in my books. I\u2019ve probably spent too much time in Contracts Mode now (I pray it will be expanded upon in the next game?) but I like all the mini puzzles etc you can make for other players to figure out or have fun with.\nFinal question Mr Rudd: What makes the perfect Contract?\nI dunno about \u2018perfect\u2019, but you\u2019ve done a bloody good job if there\u2019s something special or unique about your contract, but doesn\u2019t require super special knowledge of a glitch that only 2% of players know about. Stuff like a contract which can only be done if you make use of the food server function, or makes use of special items/machines in a map like the crane in Mumbai you can drop on people or the air vents in various levels; or an excuse to use loud guns or bombs but still get Silent Assassin, because there\u2019s so many items in the game but they\u2019ll rarely get used because they\u2019re not very stealthy.\n\nTime is almost up KevenRudd, so now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. Have at it!\nIf you like the game but think you\u2019ve run out of stuff to do (I\u2019ve gotten 890 hrs, personally), consider custom contracts. It can hard be hard to sort though and find the good ones, but this thread has lots of tips on how to find them and a categorised list of contracts I like if you enjoy my curated batch, as well as other people\u2019s picks.\nThank you so much for your time KevinRudd, and thanks for giving us and the community the opportunity to get to know you a bit better -!\nThank you, or as they say in Mandarin \u201cXi xi ni\u201d, Mr Clemens; you\u2019ve given me a fair shake of the sauce bottle and made an old prime minister smile :\u2019)\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/curated-contracts-kevinrudd/"},

Look out for his contracts in-game on April 16.\nLater this month we\u2019ll have a Community Focus, where you can get to know him better. \n\n\u00a0\nElusive Target Reactivation \u2013 The Serial Killer\nThe identity of this target is currently unknown, but the recent discovery of two new victims indicates he\u2019s now using Whittleton Creek as his new hunting grounds. Your task is to take him down and you have 10 days to do it. You\u2019ll earn the Suburban Suit with Gloves for successfully completing the mission.\nIOI Monthly \u2013 April 28th? April 30!\nAfter IOI Monthly #12 in February, we got stuck on unlucky #13. Last month\u2019s stream was postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. In that light, we are still uncertain of exactly how episode #13 will go ahead, but we\u2019re working on a solution to keep in touch with our players and share upcoming Hitman news. Keep an eye on our official Twitter account for updates and pencil in April 28 30.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-april-content-calendar/"},

We will hand-pick 10 Contracts from the Official Submission Thread on Hitman Forum and they will be added to the game for everyone to play on March 5th. We\u2019re leaning on the theme of \u2018Lucky Break\u2019 this month and we look forward to seeing exactly how you adapt that into a Contract idea.\nElusive Target Reactivation\nMiranda Jamison is a world-famous art appraiser \u2013 but also a key figure involved in extensive price fixing within the art world. After attempting to steal a valuable piece of art, the owner has requested the ICA to \u2018permanently retire\u2019 her and retrieve her notebook. That gives you one target, two objectives, 10 days and endless possibilities. Good luck.\u00a0\nCurated Contracts\nTheCurator is TheContractor. This month, our chosen curator is the mastermind behind the Community Trials and a big part of the 12 Days of Contracts as well as frequently submitting contracts to be Featured \u2013 making the cut on four occasions. As their name might suggest, TheContractor knows a thing or two about contracts and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing what choices they make. We\u2019ll also have a spotlight article about them live on our website before the Curated Contracts are available in-game.\nIOI Monthly\nYour monthly look behind the scenes at IO Interactive returns for the 13th episode. Tune in for the first reveal of the bumper April Content Schedule, find out who takes the lead in the next round of Contracts Showdown and get your questions answered by the IOI Community Team.

He was given the task of picking 10 contracts for you to enjoy! Many of you might know him as one of the Speedrunning-Connoisseurs from all over the HITMAN community. He\u2019s fast, he\u2019s funny and he\u2019s Frote7.\nNow, let\u2019s get a little closer to this fast-maniac and find out more about him and the Contracts that he\u2019s chosen to be featured \u2013 they\u2019ll be live in HITMAN 2 on Thursday February 20.\n\nHello Frote7!\nHi IOI friends! Hope you are doing well.\nWe\u2019re great \u2013 and happy to have you as a Curator. Can you give us some intel on who you are?\nTHAT is Frote7, the clown. Supermodel turned spymaster, turned pirate, turned clown. Quite the resum\u00e9.\nQuite. Before we get into more details, where can people find/watch/follow you online?\nYou can find me streaming on Twitch. I upload all my runs to YouTube. Besides that you can find me on Twitter.\nOK. First things first: when did you first stumble upon the Bald Assassin?\nWatching a friend play Codename 47, did not have a PC myself at the time, but the game looked awesome. First Hitman game I owned myself was Hitman 2: Silent Assassin.\nWhat about your favourite Hitman game, and why?\nHas to be HITMAN 2016. Simple reason is that it\u2019s the game where I had the most fun with, and put the most time in.\nA solid choice. What about the most recent game; what\u2019s your favourite map from HITMAN 2?\nIf we are strictly speaking HITMAN 2 maps: Miami, closely followed by The Bank. If we are including Legacy, then Paris is still the best map by far.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favourite moment about the Hitman franchise? This could be anything from in-game to something you\u2019ve seen or made etc.\nIf we\u2019re talking about in-game, it\u2019s the first time playing Paris. I was so impressed and overwhelmed, felt like a kid in a candy store. Outside of the game it\u2019s getting invited to IOI HQ &amp; the HITMAN 2 event at Gamescom in the summer of 2018. But my upmost favorite moment was: meeting Adoria (my girlfriend \u2764\ufe0f) via HITMAN.\nA true Hitman love story. Speaking of other community members, we know that you\u2019ve set-up a \u201cSpeedrunning Community\u201d. Tell us more.\nIt started out as a one time thing: I wanted to organize a Speedrun Competition with some prizes. MulletPride then offered to help me by setting up a Discord for me and making some artwork. The response was so overwhelmingly positive that I was highly motivated to continue.\u00a0 In 2019, we\u2019ve had 3 big Speedrun competitions, 1 Ghost Mode tournament and a bunch of weekly competitions.\nNow in 2020 we\u2019re stepping up our game: The year is divided in 4 seasons, each season consisting of 3 months. Each month will have 1 big competition (including prize money), 2 mini-competitions and batch of our own featured contracts made by previous month\u2019s winners. We also provide lots of live commentary for our big events.\nWe\u2019ve had the Roulette Rivals event in January, Ghost Mode Tournament 2 is currently underway, and we got Speedrun Competition 4 coming up in March. This week we reached 500 members on our Discord, which is just incredibly awesome!\nAnd the best thing of all? Participating in our events is completely free! So if you want to put your Hitman skills to the test, learn a lot about the mechanics of the game and meet cool players from a very active and friendly community: Join our discord!\n \nWe\u2019re obviously happy to see such a popular community take shape \u2013 and it\u2019s about speedrunning. Can you share why speedrunning is so great?\nThis is a very good question, and one that i thought about quite a lot. Is it the competitive aspect? The sense of satisfaction when pulling off a cool run? Getting to truly understanding of the game\u2019s mechanics? The pure joy and entertainment of watching a run evolve over time? A mix of it all? Well, I found this video that touched on some very good points, and explains it better than I could.\nBut in short: It\u2019s simply very, very fun.\n\n\nNOW \u2013 Time to talk about Contracts!\n\nCan you share your secret on how you went about choosing/creating/ finding the 10 contracts, what was your process?\nI started the process by looking at [REDACTED]. In my opinion, when selecting contracts you always have to take [REDACTED] into account, because else you will run into [REDACTED]. Once that is done, I look at which [REDACTED] would add a lot for [REDACTED]. It\u2019s not a long or difficult process, but it\u2019s very important to not forget about [REDACTED].\nAha, guess not \u2013 fair \ud83d\ude09 Then can you tell us about the contracts you\u2019ve chosen/ created and why you chose them?\nIt\u2019s a mix. I\u2019ve picked several from our speedrun competitions since they are simply very good contracts.\u00a0 I also wanted a good Fiber Wire Suit Only contract in there, and finally picked some quality contracts from masters like Urben and Euler13. Despite people was expecting me to have picked 10 Paris contracts, no go, each map only gets featured once haha.\nSmart move! Okay, final question: When you normally start a contract, what is that one item you always bring \u2013 and why do you like it so much?\nNone. It all depends on the contract i\u2019m playing and what I need for that particular one. But the silenced pistol is still the best item/weapon in the game, it\u2019s just so versatile.\nVersatile and a classic, love it. Okay, we know we said the final question, but this is the final final question \u2013 why the Clown suit?\nHaha I feel like it represents my personality\u00a0 + I think it\u2019s the best out of all the suits. And at this point, me and that particular suit has become inseparable.\n\nThat was the all the questions Frote7, so now is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. The floor is yours!\nWant to start by giving a huge shoutout to my admin team: MulletPride, Adoria, Fuzk, Scroobi &amp; Karma! Our Speedrun Community would not have been what it is without your help. Love you guys.\nShoutout to the people helping us to promote our competitions, and to all the great runners! Special mention for my bro Mendietinha \u2764\ufe0f\nLast but not least, make sure to tune in for the Ghost Mode Tournament 2 Grand Finals this Sunday (February 23 \u2013 2020)\u00a0 There will be live commentary for all 3 finals on my Twitch channel.\nHope to see you all there!\nOn that note, Thank you for your \u201ctime\u201d Frote7! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8\nReally? You just couldn\u2019t resist huh? Haha\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/curated-contracts-frote7/"},

Here\u2019s your breakdown of this month\u2019s upcoming content:\nFeatured Contracts\nWe will hand-pick 10 Contracts from the Official Submission Thread on Hitman Forum and they will be added to the game for everyone to play on February 6th. This month\u2019s theme is \u2018Lost Love\u2019 to signify February as the month of love, at least in some quarters. As a reminder, the themes are purposefully open-ended to give our creators a chance to stamp their own interpretation of the theme onto their contracts. You have until February 3rd to get your submission in!\nElusive Target Reactivation\nThe Revolutionary is back! Vicente Murillo will be patrolling Santa Fortuna once more for 10 days. As this is a reactivated Elusive Target, it\u2019s worth reminding that if you\u2019ve already completed or failed this Elusive Target, your record will stand and you won\u2019t be able to play it again.\nCurated Contracts\nIn addition to Featured Contracts, we have also got a community curator lined up to pick some of their favourite contracts and have them included in the game. We\u2019ll also be giving them some room on the blog to tell us why they chose the contracts. The Curator for February will be Frote7, who is a well-known member of the community for his knowledge of the game, especially with regards to speedrunning.\nIOI Monthly\nYour monthly look behind the scenes at IO Interactive returns for another episode.

{"title": "Curated Contracts: MulletPride", "date": "January 22, 2020", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tOur first official Contract Curator for 2020 is here! As we introduced on the January Content Calendar \u2013 his name is MulletPride and he was tasked with picking out 10 contracts to be Featured in HITMAN 2 as part of our January Content Calendar.\nNow, we\u2019re ready to find out more about him and the Contracts that he has chosen to be featured \u2013 they\u2019ll be live in HITMAN 2 on January 23. Before you get the chance to play the 10 contracts that he\u2019s chosen tomorrow, we\u2019re putting him under the spotlight to find out more about him. Let\u2019s go!\n\nHello MulletPride!\n\nGreetings Clemens, Travis, and all of the other awesome people at IO Interactive. It\u2019s an honor to chat with you guys.\n\u00a0\nCan you give us some intel on who you are?\nAppropriate question seeing as how I haven\u2019t been in the Hitman community all that long. I go by Mullet! And before you even ask, no I don\u2019t have a mullet\u2026 not anymore. Decided to get rid of that when I became a father. But now I have a fancy moustache, and most of the community members like to tease me for that. I am soon to be 27 years old and live in Ohio in the United States. Besides grinding your game, I also like to write/play music, I play disc golf religiously, I play in an indoor soccer/football league and one day I would like to publish a book! I work as a project manager in a factory where we build heaters, and I also work as a farmhand part-time in the spring and summer.\n\u00a0\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\nYou can find me on Twitch where I like to stream Hitman and a variety of single-player campaign games. Most recently I played Horizon Zero Dawn and HITMAN 2 on stream. I also try to make good HITMAN content on my YouTube channel. Frote7 inspired me to do speedrunning videos, and Urben inspired me to do funny/montage videos. I play HITMAN on both PS4 and XB1 and can be added/followed there too. Lastly, I have a Twitter account that I can be followed on.\n\u00a0\nWhen did you first stumble upon the Bald Assassin?\nBack when I had an Xbox 360, Hitman: Absolution was made free with the \u2018Games With Gold\u2019 access, so I downloaded it and played it through twice. Even though it\u2019s not one of the fan-favorites in the series, I have a special spot in my heart for it, since I would never be around the newer HITMAN games without it!\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is your favourite Hitman game, and why?\n\nHITMAN 2 (2018) is my favorite Hitman game, and it goes back to what I said earlier. I haven\u2019t been in the Hitman scene/community for a very long time. I played Absolution twice through, and then I played HITMAN 2016 as a completionist; I went for all of the challenges in each map, but I didn\u2019t even know what Elusive Targets were, or even try the Contracts game mode. I followed the game and community much closer upon HITMAN 2\u2019s release and learned that there is much more to the game besides playing the main missions repeatedly.\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s your favourite map from HITMAN 2?\nIf we\u2019re speaking strictly new HITMAN 2 maps, I would have to say Miami. If you want to extend that to the Legacy Pack, I would have to say Sapienza. Miami has a wonderful energy to it across the entire map; I love the vibrant colors, the racetrack is a unique addition that we hadn\u2019t seen before, and I\u2019ve played countless contracts that I thoroughly enjoyed from here. Sapienza is the same for similar reasons involving the aura, colors and contracts. Sapienza also has many biomes that all have a nice setting for featuring contracts, may it be the mansion, the beach/church area, or the underground cave.\n\n\nAnd what\u2019s your favourite moment, in HITMAN? Can be anything, from in-game to something you\u2019ve seen, played etc.\nObviously being the first curator of HITMAN 2 and first curator of the decade. Haha. I actually have to give credit to Frote7 again for this one. He was streaming HITMAN 2 on Twitch and mentioned wanting to set up his own Speedrun Competition. I told him that I could set up a Discord server for him to organize this event, and I could also make him promotional art to help spread the word. This was back in August 2019 and not even five months later, the community Discord has risen to well over 400 members. Frote7 and I have hosted 3 Speedrun Competitions and a Ghost Mode Tournament, all of which have brought in some of the most skilful and competitive HITMAN players across the globe. I guess the TLDR would be, co-hosting events with my buddy Frote. [Editor\u2019s Note: Want in on the Speedrun Discord? Click this link to join.]\n\nNOW \u2013 Contracts time!\n\nHow did you go about choosing/creating/finding the 10 contracts, what was your process?\n\nI had a private message from Clemens immediately after the last IO Monthly, asking if I would like to be the curator. After a brief OMG moment and accepting the role, he told me to keep things on the lowdown, while also giving me almost complete freedom on selecting contracts. Rather than selecting contracts that I had already played, I actually asked specific friends, content creators and contract masters to make me a new contract. I didn\u2019t tell them that it was going to be used in the Curator Batch, but rather told them to make a contract similar to previous ones that I had played. So other than maybe one or two of these contracts, I will be playing them for the first time with the rest of the community!\n\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a different way to do it \u2013 and that\u2019s your call as the Curator. Tell us more about the contracts you\u2019ve chosen to give our community an idea of what to expect.\nI can group some of my contracts into different categories based on why I like them. The first style of contract/gameplay I want to highlight is speedrunning. I\u2019m in no way one of the best speedrunners, but I really do enjoy this style of play. My favorite types of contracts to speedrun are \u201cAny Method, Any Disguise\u201d or maybe limiting to one method and/or one disguise. I enjoy freedom in a contract because it gives many different approaches to the same few targets. Hitman is, after all, a puzzle game, and I just like to put the puzzle together as fast as possible. This leads to my next type of contract/style of play, which are elaborate puzzles or roleplaying contracts. Have you ever played a contract and just thought for a while: \u201cHow in the hell do I go about even doing this?\u201d I love these contracts, and it is very satisfactory to finally complete them.\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s talk a bit more about how you like to approach a Hitman level \u2013 is there a particular item that you just *need* to have in your loadout?\n\nHonestly, I always enjoy having a briefcase with me. I would say that I always want to bring a sniper rifle with me, but that isn\u2019t always the best means of eliminating targets. The briefcase is great for concealing whatever items, especially a sniper rifle, but also doubles as a great throwable melee weapon. Besides that, the briefcase just looks professional while wearing a suit, and I like that professional assassin look!\n\u00a0\nNow is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. Have at it!\n\nA special shoutout to Mr. Ding, Scroob and Penny. The group of us created our own campaign within HITMAN 2, called APA: A Contract Series. There is a full story written throughout the briefings, one contract in each location (minus Hawkes Bay). These contracts have been expertly put together using our APA conditions: Accident Kill, Pistol Kill, Any Method. They have been exposed on Hitman Forum already, but I want to shout them out again. We did APA Part 1 in the Legacy Pack maps and wrapped up the series in APA Part 2 in the H2 maps. Some of these are simple and quick, some of them are very puzzling. Hope you enjoy them! [Editor\u2019s Note: If you want to find the APA Contracts, this HitmanForum thread that Mullet mentioned above has all the ID\u2019s]\nThanks Mullet!\n\nThank you guys for having me and thank you for doing what you guys do. I\u2019ve never played a game with a live service such as HITMAN 2 and I think it is underappreciated. Can\u2019t wait to see me as an NPC in the next Hitman game (hehe, come on, do it), and also hyped for the new IP, whatever that may be.

(A convenient name if ever there was one!) From there, more and more contract\u00a0elves contract creators were involved and each of them created a holiday-themed contract of their own choosing. Now, we are releasing all 12 of them into HITMAN 2 for all players to enjoy today.\nHere on the blog, we\u2019ll be opening a new window on our 12 Days of Contracts Calendar each day and we\u2019ll be giving each creator a chance to talk about their contracts. We\u2019re hoping that this will give you more insight into the creators and the contracts themselves \u2013 even if you\u2019ve already played their contract in-game!\nLook out for the following Hitman community members appearing here on this page over the next 12 days:\nTheContractor, Urben, KevinRudd, PEA, AgentJames, Sniff, SASO, MrNinjafreak, CHAOS_AGENT_45, Euler13, SANY-72Q and GreekAgent.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOn the First Day of Contracts...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tChimney Watchers\nCreated by: TheContractor\n\ud83c\udf84 Contract Briefing:\nBodyguards aren\u2019t notoriously nice, but 3 in the Caruso villa have been especially naughty this year.

Let\u2019s drop them a present they won\u2019t soon forget!\nBut remember, Santa\u2019s a pacifist and on the clock so no guns and don\u2019t waste time!\n\ud83c\udf85 Creator Biography:\nHi, I\u2019m Thom (aka TheContractor), currently a student in the UK. I got into Hitman when I was a teenager with Absolution. I picked it up for free on Xbox Gold and I used to play the Blackwater Penthouse level for hours, trying stealth runs, kill everyone runs, everything. Then a few years ago I went to live in Hokkaido for a year. I somehow heard there was a new HITMAN and it had a Hokkaido level. So, I picked it up and have loved it since, mainly contract creation.\nMy contract this December is all about the chimneys. Sapienza has a unique mechanic of being able to blow up fireplaces by dropping propane flasks down chimneys.

Created by well-known community member and Hitman player TheKotti, this paradigm is all about the battle axe.

There will be server maintenance at the usual times between 11:00 and 15:00 UTC to prepare for this release. Stay tuned to the @IOInteractive Twitter page for updates.\nPlease be aware that the in-game version numbering (2.72.0) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Update 2.72.0: What\u2019s Changing?\n\nEmetic Throw\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the game could crash when detonating the Remote Emetic Gas Device whilst it was inside a briefcase, and then attempting to throw the briefcase at someone.\nMetal Works\nWe have fixed an issue in Mumbai where Agent 47 would be prevented from entering the roof when dressed as a metal worker, even though he would not be considered trespassing when using a different route to the roof.\nDetonation Localisation\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community\u2013reported issue where the detonator for the Remote Emetic Gas Device was not localised in some languages.\nMumbai Beach\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where items in the Beach Stash in Mumbai were misaligned to the interaction prompt.\nUsypiacz Tranquillante\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where the Kalmer-1 pistol was using an incorrect name and description in Polish and Italian.\nTime to Get Down\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u2018Vertigo\u2019 challenge from the Thriller Night Challenge Pack would not unlock in Contracts Mode, despite the conditions being met.\nGrammar Pirates\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where the pirate map parts in Haven Island were described using incorrect grammar.\nRussian Haven\nWe\u2019ve made a change to the localised name of \u201cHaven Island\u201d for players using the Russian language, based on community feedback and input from our Russian localisation experts.\nPlumber\u2019s Problems (Legacy)\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u2018Tightening the Screws\u2019 challenge from the Plumber\u2019s Apprentice Challenge Pack would pop-up in-game as completed, despite the conditions not actually being met and the challenge remaining locked.\nPatient Zero (Legacy)\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where players on Xbox One would disconnect from the game\u2019s server after successfully completing the Patient Zero mission in the HITMAN 1 GOTY campaign.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPC-Specific Notes\nAMD FidelityFX\nWe have added support for AMD\u2019s FidelityFX Contrast-Adaptive Sharpening. This algorithm recovers high frequency features lost during temporal anti-aliasing to provide a rich, detailed image. All players can take advantage of this support, regardless of their choice of graphics card. This can be toggled between Off, Weak, Moderate or Strong in the \u2018Graphics\u2019 Menu.\nDX12 CPU Usage\nWe have reduced CPU usage, which can improve framerates in certain CPU bound situations. In addition, GPU memory usage has been significantly reduced on NVIDIA cards.\nDX12 Shader Cache\nWe have made some changes that will reduce the time it takes to launch the game on DX12, especially the first time after upgrading a graphics driver, downloading a game update or a completely fresh launch.\nPC Hotfix Update (November 20)\nSince the release of the November Update on November 19, our PC community has reported that DX12 performance has actually been reduced in some circumstances. We\u2019ve been able to reproduce this at the studio and a hotfix is currently being tested. We don\u2019t have an ETA for when it will be released yet, but will share an update when we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues (2.72.0)\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it. Our November Update (2.72.0) is the final patch planned for HITMAN 2 and all remaining known issues will therefore be placed into the HITMAN 2 backlog.\u00a0\nTo save us from writing it repeatedly, \u201cWe are aware of an issue where\u2026\u201d\n\nPC players are experiencing \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes\nStatus: We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue. At this time, we don\u2019t have a specific fix planned, however we have been made aware of some community workarounds that may ease the issue for people continuing to encounter this issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SA rating is not failed when a dead body is found, if a tranquilizer was used before the lethal kill\nStatus: This is an issue with many components and to avoid creating any further issues, we have decided to place this issue in the HITMAN 2 backlog.\n\n\n\n\nFire extinguishers (and propane flasks) do not explode when an explosive is detonated on them\nStatus: This issue is situationally dependent on certain factors \u2013 including how many items there are in the room and the radius of the potential explosion.\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Hold my Hair\u2019 challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic poison causing NPCs to find the nearest trashcan (rubbish bin) instead of a toilet\nStatus: We have made some hand-crafted tweaks to the set-up for specific trashcans to allow challenges to be completed more reliably, namely those in Hokkaido that are needed to complete the Snow Festival Challenge Pack. A global fix for all trashcans has now been added to the HITMAN 2 backlog.\n\n\n\n\nTerminus Suit (Elusive Target unlock) is not unlocked immediately after completing an ET with a Silent Assassin rating\nStatus: This is a known issue that will potentially affect a small number of players for each Elusive Target. Unfortunately, we are not able to reproduce the issue and therefore fix it to prevent it from happening. However, we will \u2018fix\u2019 the issue at the end of each Elusive Target by awarding the suit to everyone that unlocked it. This process can take up to 48 hours from the end of the Elusive Target ending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nCelebrations are in full swing for HITMAN 2\u2019s Anniversary! A jam-packed month of content swung into action with The Great Heist Breaking and Entering Challenge Pack. Since then, we\u2019ve also released Legacy Challenge Packs and Escalations, a new Escalation in Santa Fortuna and 10 Featured Contracts (plus a bonus one!) across multiple locations.\nDon\u2019t miss The Bartholomew Hornswoggle later in the month to unlock your very own Buccaneer suit! #Ahoy!\nCheck out our November Roadmap blog post for a detailed rundown of all of HITMAN 2\u2019s November content.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-november-update/"},

During HITMAN 1, when he first debuted, this was the Elusive Target with the lowest success rate \u2013 all because of \u2018the diamonds\u2019.\nDuring this contract, 47 must \u201cretrieve diamonds\u201d as one of the objectives \u2013 and if you subdue or kill any of the characters involved in the diamond exchange before the exchange can happen, the contract will fail permanently because 47 will then not be able to retrieve them. We strongly advise that you approach this contract with extreme caution and read the briefing and target intel before proceeding.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tNovember 28 / Escalation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nGet in, get out, keep the change.\u00a0 That\u2019s good advice for the McCallister Ransack in Whittleton Creek.

In real terms, we\u2019re moving more and more of the HITMAN 2\u00a0team to join the next Hitman game, which\u00a0is well underway.\nThis means that we\u2019re expecting the November Update to bring the final major patch and set of Release Notes for HITMAN 2, whilst December will round out the year with the remaining new content drops for the game, including Escalations and an Elusive Target \u2013 as well as the permanent return of some Seasonal Content.\nOur 2020 plans for HITMAN 2 live content will focus on continuing to add Featured Contracts as well as introduce Community-curated Contracts into the game. On top of that, we are also planning a re-activation of HITMAN 2 Elusive Targets, giving players another chance to earn any attached rewards and experience the Elusive Target missions that you might have missed the first time around.\nWe\u2019ll talk more about this and take your questions on Episode #9 of IOI Monthly when the IOI Community Team will be back in front of the cameras for another preview of upcoming content.\nBe sure to follow us on Twitch or Mixer \u2013 and be notified the next time we go live!\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFull November Roadmap\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-november-roadmap/"},

The October Update for HITMAN 2 brings a spooky Halloween Escalation for all players to enjoy in Hawke\u2019s Bay \u2013 but that\u2019s not all! Three Halloween-related Legacy Challenge Packs are lined up for release alongside the 2.71.0 game update which brings a host of improvements to the game, especially for Haven Island.\nOn top of that, we\u2019ve got a large game update with fixes and tweaks in all areas.\n\n\n\nRelease Details and Server Maintenance\nThe October Update (aka 2.71.0) will arrive on October 22 and we expect it to be between 1.7 GB and 2 GB on consoles and 900 MB on PC. There will be server maintenance at the usual times between 11:00 and 15:00 UTC to prepare for this release. Stay tuned to the @IOInteractive Twitter page for updates.\nPlease be aware that the in-game version numbering (2.71.0) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Update 2.71.0: What\u2019s Changing?\n\nThe Fate of Bartoli the Twelfth\nWe have made a final resolution to the Bartoli Saga. The Bartoli 12G is an unlockable weapon in New York and will retain the properties of being concealable on Agent 47 but it can no longer be selected as a starting weapon. Instead, it will need to be placed in a stash and retrieved during a mission. We went back and forwards on this issue a few times but ultimately settled on a solution that works consistently without other issues. If you still want to experience walking into Paris and having your invitation checked whilst holding a shotgun, you\u2019d better be quick. We recommend using the Lynch Suit for best results.\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrophies and Tribulations\nWe have addressed a community-reported issue where trophies and achievements for completing Maximum location mastery were not awarded, despite players fulfilling the requirements. Upon launching the game with the 2.71.0 update installed, players are advised to launch the mission from the menu (do not load a save) and then complete the mission fully.\nLocation XP\nWe have made changes that will ensure players unlock trophies and achievements for completing the maximum location mastery, even if the final XP was earned on the Patient Zero campaign missions or a Special Assignment.\nSniper Suppression\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where the suppressor of the Druzhina 34 Arctic could be misplaced after a load/save cycle.\nSniper Mode Menu\nWe have made a community-requested change to the Sniper Assassin menu flow. Now, after completing a match, you will be able to return directly to the Sniper Assassin Game Mode page, making it quicker and easier to choose another map to play.\nSniper Leaderboards\nWe have made a back-end change to the Sniper Assassin leaderboards to ensure the current high scores are legitimate and put measures in place to prevent further unattainable scores.\nDruzhina Perk\nWe have updated the description of the Druzhina 34 ICA Arctic to accurately describe the perks that it has. \u201cMarksman\u201d, \u201cSuppressor\u201d and \u201cVersatile Scope\u201d have been added. For the sake of clarity, no gameplay changes have been made to the weapon.\nSniper Render\nWe have fixed an issue in the Sniper Assassin Mode that could cause characters to appear in low resolution when viewed at the lowest zoom level.\nRifle Reload\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue in Mumbai where the Kashmirian\u2019s rifle can disappear after a save/load cycle.\nDiscover Paradise\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where some players were unable to complete the \u2018Discover Haven Island\u2019 challenge and would get stuck on 40/41.\u00a0\nTrick or\u2026\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where the Banana on Haven Island was considered an illegal item on Casual Difficulty, but not on other difficulties. Now, it will be considered illegal on all difficulties.\u00a0\nParadise Lockdown\nWe have made some changes that could cause some unexpected AI behaviour during a Target Lockdown in Haven Island.\nWhat Did the Chef Say?\nWe have fixed an issue where the Chef in Haven Island was missing subtitles for their dialogue.\nHaven Animation\nWe have made several fixes to animation issues on Haven Island, including when 47 gets a massage, NPC\u2019s typing on keyboards, guards sitting and standing and NPC\u2019s eating food.\nButler Blunder\nWe have fixed an issue where the Butler would ask 47 to wait for Tyson Williams, even if Tyson is already in the room when 47 enters.\nJetski Explosions\nWe have fixed an issue where using explosives on an unused jetski in Haven Island would make it disappear entirely.\nDeck Chair Protection Incorporated\nWe have fixed an issue where Agent 47 isn\u2019t removed from a \u2018hiding in plain sight\u2019 (HIPS) spot on the deck chairs despite entering the combat state.\u00a0\nFishy Remains\nWe have fixed an issue in Haven Island where picking up a fish would leave a invisible collision box that would impede 47\u2019s movement.\nToilet Collision\nWe have fixed an issue where it was not possible to throw items into the toilets in the Haven Island gym and restaurant. We look forward to players now being able to fill all of the toilet bowls with all sorts of items. Upvotes inbound.\nClipMan\nWe have fixed an issue where there was severe clipping on Agent 47\u2019s head when under the pier in Haven Island.\nInvisible Inflatable\nWe have fixed an issue where the [REDACTED] required for an easter egg exit in Haven Island could disappear after a save/load cycle. The exit cinematic or functionality wasn\u2019t affected by the issue.\nWall of Glass\nWe have fixed an issue where Agent 47 was not visible through a glazed door near the doctor\u2019s bathroom in Haven Island, despite being in a trespassing state.\nElaborate Attire\nWe have fixed an issue that would cause certain parts of Ljudmila Vetrova\u2019s attire to clip with her body during specific animations.\nHaven Target Routine\nWe have fixed an issue where the targets in Haven Island could suspend their routines if they are distracted under certain circumstances.\n\n\u2026Treat\nOnly kidding, we\u2019ve made the banana legal on all difficulties. Happy Halloween!\nA Bitter Sweep\nWe have fixed several issues on the \u2018A Bitter Pill\u2019 Special Assignment, including animations when ringing doorbells and a guard that can walk through a closed door in certain circumstances.\nSocial Media Addict\nWe have fixed an issue in Isle of Sgail where Sophia Washington would have a phone attached to her hand permanently, caused by specific players actions.\u00a0\nCasual Charge\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where the Remote EMP Charge was considered an illegal item on Casual Difficulty, but not on other difficulties. Now, it will be considered legal on all difficulties.\u00a0\nBatty is Back\nWe have fixed an issue where it is possible to get stuck in the Batty Tranquility Escalation Contract. For example, destroying the mailman outfit does not fail the mission and it is not possible to acquire another one, which is required for an objective.\nYay, News\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where a small part of the garden belonging to Janus / Janice / \u042f\u043d\u0443\u0441 / Yahnus (other pronunciations are possible) in Whittleton Creek was not considered a trespassing zone, regardless of disguise.\nSA Tracker Camera\nWe have fixed an issue where some cameras in Master Difficulty do not affect the SA Tracker and it does not change state when it should.\nGuard Team Carry\nWe have fixed an issue where guards would carry remote devices in an unusual way.\nUI_Prop_Emetic\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where the Detonator for the Remote Emetic Gas Device is not localised in non-English languages.\nFusil X2000 Desc\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where the description for the Fusil X2000 Assault Rifle was missing in the \u2018A Bitter Pill\u2019 Special Assignment.\nSieker Danke\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where the Sieker-1 pistol had an incorrect description in German.\nGunrunner Silhouette\nWe have made fixed the image for the Gunrunner Elusive Target to be in the H2 style, rather than the H1 silhouette.\nFlorida Fit Fix\nWe have fixed an issue with corrupted textures on the trousers of the Florida Fit suit, the default suit for Miami.\nMinimal Challenge Changes\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where setting the Challenge Description to \u2018Minimal\u2019 will also result in the description of already-completed challenges being minimal. Now, you\u2019ll be able to read the full description of any completed challenges.\nLegacy: Who is The Herald?\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where the names of the challenges for eliminating Eric Soders and Yuki Yamazaki in Hokkaido were switched around.\u00a0\nCloth Render [PS4 only]\nWe have fixed an issue where some cloth items that could be affected by wind effects would visually flicker when 47 is near. This only occurred on PS4.\nExpansion Pass Store Check\nWe have made a back-end change to how the in-game store displays ownership of the Expansion Pass. The checkmark was set-up to check for whether a player was able to download and play Hantu Port in Expansion Pack 1. This was causing an issue for owners of the Silver Edition who would then see a checkmark for the Expansion Pass despite only owning Expansion Pack 1. Now, the checkmark will only show if a player is able to download and play Haven Island, which is only available through the Expansion Pass.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReports (aka What\u2019s Not Changing in 2.71.0)\nIn addition to the above changes, we also investigated some community-reported issues that we have deemed to be either \u2018as designed\u2019 or \u2018won\u2019t fix\u2019. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of those reports;\n\nReport: Gold Bar Category\nThe gold bar is placed in the melee category because we consider that to be it\u2019s primary function. Some reports suggested it would be better placed in \u2018Distractions\u2019. We disagree.\nReport: ICA Flash Phone Category\nSimilar to the above report, some players have suggested that the ICA Flash Phone be placed in the \u2018Explosives\u2019 category because that\u2019s where the other Flash devices are. However, phones are considered as tools and so will remain in that category, regardless of their function.\nReport: Lethal Food\nThe apple, cheeseburger and muffin items have the \u2018non-lethal\u2019 tag because that\u2019s how they will be experienced for the overwhelming majority of players. Whilst it is technically possible to land a final killing blow with any of these three items, it would be misleading to label them as \u2018lethal\u2019, which some players have requested / reported.\nReport: No Bodies Found\nThe Silent Assassin rating is currently lost when a player kills a target with an accident or poison and then drags the body, which is found by an NPC. As soon as the body is found, the No Bodies Found bonus is lost and the SA Tracker will turn red. The key part here is that the body is dragged after the kill. This has been the case for as long as we can remember and we have no intention to change it in the near future.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues (2.71.0)\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\u00a0\nTo save us from writing it repeatedly, \u201cWe are aware of an issue where\u2026\u201d\n\nPC players are experiencing \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes\nStatus: We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue. This remains an open issue that we are continuing to gather data on to pinpoint the cause. At this time, we don\u2019t have a specific fix planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in Contracts Mode\nStatus: This issue is caused when using specific items that are required for \u2018hidden\u2019 exits. Currently, the game is unable to detect the status of the item when dropped and so defaults to a fail state. We\u2019ve placed this issue into the HITMAN 2 backlog as we won\u2019t be fixing it in the immediate future.\nPlayers can get stuck in a situation where it\u2019s impossible to exit some Contracts in Bangkok\nStatus: This issue is caused in Contracts Mode when the Tuk-Tuk is set as a Required Exit. If the Tuk-Tuk is destroyed, the Contract will not fail and players will then be unable to complete the contract. We\u2019ve placed this issue into the HITMAN 2 backlog as we won\u2019t be fixing it in the immediate future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea Discovery challenges, in some particular edge cases, do not unlock properly\nStatus: We are confident that this has been fixed on all locations, including Haven Island with the \u2018Discover Paradise\u2019 fix mentioned above. If you do continue to have this issue after completing a clean completion of the affected mission with the 2.71.0 update installed, please get in touch with us with specific details.\nThe SA rating is not failed when a dead body is found, if a tranquilizer was used before the lethal kill\nStatus: This is an issue with many components and we are still investigating a fix that doesn\u2019t have other impact on the systems that are affected.\nFire extinguishers (and propane flasks) no longer explode when an explosive is detonated on them\nStatus: We\u2019ve made progress on this issue and have had success with fire extinguishers exploding when using a breaching charge, propane flask and a gas canister. However, the issue seems to be situationally dependent on certain factors \u2013 including how many items there are in the room / radius of the potential explosion. We are investigating a permanent fix.\n\u2018Hold my Hair\u2019 challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic poison causing NPCs to find the nearest trashcan (rubbish bin) instead of a toilet\nStatus: We have identified the issue that seems to be causing NPC preference to trashcans rather than toilets and made some progress on solving it. We are continuing to work towards a permanent solution that would involve having NPC\u2019s strongly favour a toilet over a trashcan.\nPlayers are unable to complete the \u2018Mission Mastery\u2019 challenge in Marrakesh (House Built on Sand) and unlock the Janbiya.\nStatus: We have brought this issue back under the spotlight and working towards a final and definitive fix following player reports that previous fixes have not worked for them. The set-up for these particular challenges are more complex under-the-hood than they look. We will share a renewed status update next month.\nTerminus Suit (Elusive Target unlock) is not unlocked immediately after completing an ET with a Silent Assassin rating\nStatus: This is a known issue that will potentially affect a small number of players for each Elusive Target. Unfortunately, we are not able to reproduce the issue and therefore fix it to prevent it from happening. However, we will \u2018fix\u2019 the issue at the end of each Elusive Target by awarding the suit to everyone that unlocked it. This process can take up to 48 hours from the end of the Elusive Target ending.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nOctober Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nThe October Roadmap is almost wrapped up \u2013 but not quite! We\u2019ve still got the huge drop of THREE Legacy Challenge Packs plus our Halloween-themed Escalation Contract plus a new Elusive Target on Whittleton Creek starting on Friday 25th October for 10 days! We round the month off with a Hawke\u2019s Bay Challenge Pack that will unlock the Red-Tie Kiwi.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-october-update/"},

{"title": "HITMAN 2 \u2013 September Update", "date": "September 23, 2019", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe September Update for HITMAN 2 brings another blockbuster month of updates, improvements and fixes \u2013 plus a brand new location and two Special Assignment missions for Expansion Pass owners!\nThe headline act is Haven Island, a brand new sandbox location that welcomes players to the warm beaches and tropical paradise of The Maldives. The narrative thread of this mission picks up directly after the events in the New York bank and brings an exciting conclusion to the HITMAN 2 Expansion Pass content.\nTwo new special assignments also take Agent 47 to Miami and Whittleton Creek, with one mission leading into the next. 47 begins in Miami with his target as the head of a company known as Atlantide\u2026\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nRelease Details and Server Maintenance\nThe September Update (aka 2.70.0) will arrive on September 24 and we expect it to be between 1 GB and 1.5 GB on consoles and 700 MB on PC. There will be server maintenance at the usual times between 11:00 and 15:00 UTC to prepare for this release. Stay tuned to the @IOInteractive Twitter page for updates.\nPlease be aware that the in-game version numbering (2.70.0) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExpansion Pass Content Release Details\nOwners of the Expansion Pass will be able to download the new Haven Island location and Special Assignment Pack 2 from their platform stores starting on September 24. We recommend that you always search for it directly on the platform store and download the content from there.\nLocation: Haven Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Assignment: A Silver Tongue (Miami)\n\n\n\nSpecial Assignment: A Bitter Pill (Whittleton Creek)\n\nHaven Island and the Special Assignments Pack 2 will release at the same time \u2013 but the exact time will vary depending on your platform and region. Here is a full list of the release times for the new content and when you can begin downloading.\nHaven Island DLC on consoles will be approximately 3.5 GB and Special Assignments Pack 2 will be approximately 8.5 GB, due to including two locations in the pack. On PC, Haven Island clocks in at approximately 2.5 GB and Special Assignments Pack 2 will be 7.5 GB.\nSeptember 24th\nXbox One (Global) 13:00 UTC\nPS4 (Europe) 13:00 UTC\nPS4 (North America) 15:00 UTC\nPC (Global) 17:00 UTC\nSeptember 25th\nPS4 (Asia) 03:00 UTC\nPS4 (Japan) 03:00 UTC\n\n\nGame Update 2.70.0: What\u2019s Changing?\n\nItem Labels\nWe have added clear, colour-coded labels to items that make them easier to see at a glance when selecting them in the in-game inventory. For example, the Chloroform Flask will have the \u2018Consumed Poison\u2019 label and a purple \u2018Sedative\u2019 label.\nAccident KO\u2019s\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where NPC\u2019s that were knocked out / pacified by an accident and then found by another NPC would cause the Silent Assassin rating to be failed.\nSuit You\nWe have fixed a community-reported issue where The Summer Suave Suit (Hot Summer) and the Cashmerian suit does not count as a \u2018suit\u2019 with regards to challenges and Contracts Mode.\nMission Story Shutdown\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where elements of Mission Story guidance could be encountered even when it was disabled in the Options Menu.\nBank Blocker\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue in New York where items that were placed or dropped under the bank truck could not be retrieved.\nBank Reverb\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause some dialogue in New York to occur with higher than expected reverb.\nThe Void\nWe have closed a gate to the Upside Down that could be found in New York when opening the door to the break room.\nBank Robber\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Agent 47 could rob the Bank in New York with just his finger guns. Alternatively, we have fixed an issue where 47 could drop a weapon whilst aiming and then continue \u2018aiming\u2019 without the weapon. This was only possible when the Weapon Aim setting was toggled on.\n\n\n\nPlease don't patch this, this is so hilarious @IOInteractive @IO_Travishttps://t.co/ukrKgH6ZEU pic.twitter.com/1UgwZG17Zy\n\u2014 Konrad Ledzion (@konradledzion00) July 30, 2019\n\n4-star SA\nWe have fixed an issue where a 4-star Silent Assassin rating could be achieved when 47 is spotted / noticed by targets before eliminating them.\nIllegal Action\nAs part of a continuous effort to improve the overall experience of the in-game HUD, we have made a change to the description of illegal items in the interaction wheel. That\u2019s the box that appears when you have chosen to perform an interaction and need to choose what item you want to use. Previously, an illegal action would say \u2018Executing this action while visible to others will get you into trouble\u2019. We\u2019ve simplified this to simply say \u2018Illegal Action\u2019.\nSmooth Scroll\nWe\u2019ve made a quality-of-life change to the text scrolling, so that it\u2019s now smooth as butter.\n\nInconsistent Sniper Scores\nWe have fixed an issue that could cause inconsistency in score during a co-op match in Sniper Assassin.\nFlash Crash\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where PS4 players could encounter a crash when eqipping both new items from the Smart Casual Pack in their loadout.\nGhost Crash\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue on Xbox One where a multiplayer error in Ghost Mode could be caused when sending an invite to another player.\nLocation Division\nWe\u2019ve made a small tweak to the Destination menu to better separate the sandbox locations from the Sniper Assassin maps.\nLegacy: A House Built on Janbiya\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u2018Mission Mastery\u2019 challenge in Marrakesh &gt; A House Built on Sand would not be completed, despite players completing the requirements. To earn progression on this challenge, players will need to complete all Mission Stories and 5 Assassination challenges.\nIllegal Action\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause an edge case scenario where players who purchased a Location Pack (e.g Miami Pack) and then the Expansion Pass were unable to purchase the Upgrade Pack and therefore access to the remaining locations in HITMAN 2.\nWhere It\u2019s Due, Part Two\nWe have updated the in-game credits to include the work done on our new content (Haven Island &amp; new Special Assignments) as well as new members of the team.\nEmetic Island\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the inventory image used for the Emetic Grenade was displaying as the regular Flash Grenade. The correct image will now be shown.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\u00a0\nTo save us from writing it repeatedly, \u201cWe are aware of an issue where\u2026\u201d\n\nPC players are experiencing \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes\nStatus: We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue. This remains an open issue that we are continuing to gather data on to pinpoint the cause. At this time, we don\u2019t have a specific fix planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in Contracts Mode\nStatus: This issue is caused when using specific items that are required for \u2018hidden\u2019 exits. Currently, the game is unable to detect the status of the item when dropped and so defaults to a fail state. Investigations into a permanent fix are ongoing.\nArea Discovery challenges, in some particular edge cases, do not unlock properly\nStatus: We believe that this issue is fixed, however we are awaiting confirmation from community members that have helped us to troubleshoot it. If you are having this issue, please report it to us to expedite this process.\nThe SA rating is not failed when a dead body is found, if a tranquilizer was used before the lethal kill\nStatus: This is an issue with many components and we are investigating a fix that doesn\u2019t have other impact on the systems that are affected.\nFire extinguishers (and propane flasks) no longer explode when an explosive is detonated on them\nStatus: We\u2019ve made progress on this issue and have had success with fire extinguishers exploding when using a breaching charge, propane flask and a gas canister. However, the issue seems to be situationally dependent on certain factors \u2013 including how many items there are in the room / radius of the potential explosion. We are investigating a permanent fix.\n\u2018Hold my Hair\u2019 challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic poison causing NPCs to find the nearest trashcan (rubbish bin) instead of a toilet\nStatus: We have identified the issue that seems to be causing NPC preference to trashcans rather than toilets and made some progress on solving it. It appears to have stemmed from a previous change for a specific trashcan and we have made some changes in the live game for it but are continuing to work towards a final solution.\nThe Bartoli 12G shotgun (New York unlock) can be selected as a concealed weapon, but cannot actually be concealed\nStatus: We are tracking this and aiming to lock down a permanent solution for how the weapon is configured.\nTerminus Suit (Elusive Target unlock) is not unlocked immediately after completing an ET with a Silent Assassin rating\nStatus: Whilst the unlock will be awarded properly for most players, this is a known issue that we have tracked to affect a small minority of players, which will continue to affect the live game. However, we will \u2018fix\u2019 the issue at the end of each Elusive Target by awarding the suit to everyone that unlocked it. This process can take up to 48 hours from the end of the Elusive Target ending.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSeptember Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nThe September Roadmap is almost complete \u2013 but not quite! The Angel of Death returns for her moment in the spotlight to round out the month before we look ahead to October \u2013 and the release of some long-requested community content and items.

Enjoy!\nObjective: Eliminate Tyson Williams\n\nAfter an unremarkable childhood in the American midwest, Tyson found employment in Chicago as a store detective. After an encounter with a knife-wielding shoplifter, he beat the thief into unconsciousness and got five years for aggravated assault.\nHis prison time gained him some contacts \u2013 but also saw his mental health deteriorate and his personality changed drastically. Following his release, he moved to New York and essentially became an illegal bounty hunter under the ruse of a private investigation agency.\nOver time, he recruited both Ljudmila Vetrova and Steven Bradley to both improve his company profile and develop new software. Ultimately, this led to Haven becoming world-leaders in tracking \u2013 and covering the tracks \u2013 of practically anyone in the world.\nRead the full Tyson Williams intel in HITMAN 2.\n\u00a0\nObjective: Eliminate Ljudmila Vetrova\n\nBorn to a KGB couple working in the UK around the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ljudmila is a confidence artist who made a lot of money claiming to be the heir to a great fortune.\nAfter running away from her boarding school at the age of 16, she eventually travelled across Europe and fell in with a crowd of travellers who toured Eastern Europe \u2013 and it was with this group that she learnt many of the confidence tricks that served her well for many years. Eventually, she was discovered by Tyson Williams and went into business with him.\nCurrently, she uses her old tricks to generate business for Haven by getting men into embarrassing situations on various online dating sites and then stepping in to offer them a way out \u2013 use Haven to wipe your past clear. The perfect setup. So far.\nRead the full Ljudmila Vetrova intel in HITMAN 2.\n\u00a0\nObjective: Eliminate Steven Bradley\n\nAfter scraping through his college studies, Steven decided to take up a career as a programmer for a startup web company, which ended in spectacular failure for the concept and the suicide of Steven\u2019s partner. Despite that, he managed to come out on top after creating a unified login system that he patented and convinced a large social media corporation to adapt.\nAt this point, he\u2019s worth millions but when his spending starts increasing, it becomes clear that the lifestyle he has chosen for himself isn\u2019t going to hold. He turns to using his own invention to access the private data of hundreds of millions of people around the world and then selling it off in smaller chunks to foreign powers, smaller marketing houses and private investigation companies.\nThis leads Steven to be offered a steady paycheck by Tyson Williams to build tools that can be used for online reputation management. Now, he lives in the Maldives as most of his tools are automated, leaving him to lead a life of luxury.\nRead the full Steven Bradley intel in HITMAN 2.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMISSION MASTERY\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tHaven Island includes 20 levels of Mission Mastery, with each level bringing something new that can change your approach to the mission.

All HITMAN 2 owners will also get a host of quality-of-life improvements for various aspects of the game and numerous fixes and tweaks in this month\u2019s update.\nFull details about the new content, maintenance/release timings and the update information are listed below.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nRelease Details and Server Maintenance\nThe August Update (aka 2.60.0) will arrive on August 27 and we expect it to be between 1 GB and 1.5 GB on consoles and 600 MB on PC. There will be server maintenance at the usual times between 11:00 and 15:00 UTC to prepare for this release. Stay tuned to the @IOInteractive Twitter page for updates.\nPlease be aware that the in-game version numbering (2.60.0) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExpansion Pass Content Release Details\nOwners of the Expansion Pass will be able to download the new Smart Casual Pack from their platform stores starting on August 27. We recommend that you always search for it directly on the platform store and download the content from there.\n\n\n\n\nThe release time for the Smart Casual Pack will vary depending on your platform and region. Here is a full list of the release times for the new pack and when you can begin downloading.\nAugust 27th\nXbox One (Global) 13:00 UTC\nPS4 (Europe) 13:00 UTC\nPS4 (North America) 15:00 UTC\nPC (Global) 17:00 UTC\nAugust 28th\nPS4 (Asia) 03:00 UTC\nPS4 (Japan) 03:00 UTC\n\n\nGame Update 2.60.0: What\u2019s Changing?\n\nSniper Chamber Reload Speed\nWe\u2019ve added a visual indicator for all Sniper Rifles (when scoped) to indicate how long it will take Agent 47 to add another bullet to the chamber (or the time it will take before you can fire another shot). This will be only be visible for Sniper Rifles but on both Sniper Assassin maps and campaign/sandbox missions. A similar indicator will also be visible to show the time for a full reload.\nIn the image below, you can see the \u2018chamber load progression\u2019 in the bottom right-hand third of the scope, as well as how many bullets are left in the magazine before you need to reload.\nThe image also includes some subtle hints to an upcoming Expansion Pass location, currently known only as \u2018The Resort\u2019.\n\n\nSniper Assassin SA\nWe\u2019ve made a change to ensure that the \u2018Sniper Assassin\u2018 challenge is unlocked when completing the necessary requirements and earning the SA rating. The SA rating is awarded even if a target spots 47 before they can share that knowledge, however this logic was not applied to the \u2018Sniper Assassin\u2018 challenges. This meant that it was possible to earn the SA rating but not unlock the Sniper Assassin challenge.\nNot That Fast\nWe\u2019ve made a change to when the \u2018Exit Mission\u2019 prompt becomes available, as a follow-up to a change we made in April. After eliminating the final target, there will now be a 3-second delay until the \u2018Exit Mission\u2019 prompt appears and players can exit.\nNo Evidence\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u2018No Evidence\u2018 challenge does not unlock if either; the body of a sedated NPC is found, or if a target finds a pacified/killed body \u2013 even if 47 kills the target before they share that knowledge.\nTag Team\nWhen viewing items in the in-game inventory, we have simplified the tags. Instead of each item reading \u2018Non-lethal melee\u2019 AND \u2018Non-lethal throw\u2019, it will now have a single \u2018Non-lethal\u2019 tag. Same change for \u2018Lethal\u2019 items too.\nFrisk Detection\nWhen viewing your in-game inventory, we have removed the \u2018Detected During Frisk\u2019 tag, since it is no longer possible to get frisked with an illegal item in your inventory. Instead, we will now display a \u2018Not Detected During Frisk\u2019 tag on relevant items. This change will make those items easier to identify and remove redundant tags from many illegal items.\n\n\nCar Crash\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that prevents the \u2018Sniper Assassin\u2018 challenge from unlocking in Miami when eliminating Sierra Knox while she is in her car.\nFinancial Issues\nWe have [unfortunately] fixed an [amusing] issue where the CEO of the Bank in New York would somehow manage to recover from falling through the clock to pick up a coin that she had dropped in the process of falling. Immediately after picking up the coin, she would then attempt to lean on the clock again and start falling before somehow managing to recover and pick up the coin that she had dropped, before\u2026\nHostile Termination\nWe\u2019ve made a change to make it possible for 47 to \u2018push\u2019 Athena Savalas directly through the clock when she is leaning against it. Although the prompt says \u2018push\u2019, you should be prepared for Agent 47\u2019s trademark kick. We can also confirm that if Savalas is holding a coin, she won\u2019t be able to recover from the kick to grab it. Target (literally) down.\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Way Conversation\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue in New York where bodies could be seen through the one-way mirror if 47 is in the conference room.\nThe Heist\nWe have fixed an issue that could cause \u2018The Heist\u2019 Mission Story in New York to disappear from the Notebook menu, in specific circumstances.\nItem_Name\nWe have fixed an issue where the [REDACTED] would have a placeholder name (for players using a non-English language) when discovered in New York (The Bank).\nVault Lasers\nWe\u2019ve made the laser beams in the New York bank vault easier to see and a lot more visible in Instinct. Whilst this issue wasn\u2019t specifically reported by our community, we saw a lot of players enabling Instinct on livestreams and expecting to get a better overview of the vault\u2019s security system.\n\n\nSiberia Sweep\nWe\u2019ve fixed various minor issues that will improve the stability, consistency and enjoyment of Siberia. This includes challenges unlocking, targets and NPCs suspending their routines and game crashes.\nSuit Order\nWe\u2019ve adjusted the order of the suits when displayed in the menus to be consistent with H1 locations, H2 locations, unlocks and DLC suits.\nET Challenges\nWe have fixed an issue that was preventing players from earning progress (and suit unlocks) when completing Elusive Targets. This cahnge will take place during the maintenance window for the update. We\u2019ll be scanning for reports and feedback once the servers are back online.\nBartoli 12G\nWe have made a change that allows the \u2018Sawed Off Bartoli 12G\u2019 shotgun to be selected as a concealable weapon in your loadout and placed into small Agency Pickups.\n\n\nLegacy: Hallucinogenic Master\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause Ezra Berg to drop (and smash) a vial of hallucinogenic drugs when being killed or pacified. Now, he will only drop them.\nLegacy: Sand Houses\nWe have fixed an issue where the Mission Mastery challenge in A House Built on Sand would not unlock, preventing players from earning the \u2018Janbiya\u2019. To earn progression on this challenge, players will need to complete all Mission Stories and 5 Assassination challenges.\nLegacy: Hokkaido Morgue\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause 47 to be immediately spotted when starting the mission in the Morgue.\nLegacy: One Night in Bangkok\nWe\u2019ve made a change so that the achievement/trophy for reaching Bangkok Mastery Level 20 will now unlock correctly. We recommend that players completely close HITMAN 2 and then complete the Bangkok \u2018Club 27\u2019 mission to trigger the achievement to unlock.\nLegacy: Bangkok Cupboard\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that made it impossible for 47 to take a disguise from bodies hidden in a specific closet on the 3rd floor.\n\n\n\n\nPC-Specific Fixes\nContract Crash\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause players with low-end Nvidia cards to encounter a crash when attempting to launch a contract.\nDX12 Stability\nWe have improved stability when using DX12 on Nvidia graphic cards.\nGPU Memory Usage\nThe Options&gt;Graphics menu now displays GPU memory usage on DX12.\nCategory Navigation Shortcuts\nWe\u2019ve added shortcuts for navigating between weapon and gear categories (pistol/shotgun, melee/explosives, etc) and challenges (feats/assassination/classics, etc). We\u2019ve added two options: Use Home and End / Q and E to navigate left and right. (Note that these shortcuts will not have in-game prompts, so feel free to make a \u201cPSA\u201d thread on Reddit to share the word and we\u2019ll give it some gold.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\u00a0\nTo save us from writing it repeatedly, \u201cWe are aware of an issue where\u2026\u201d\n\nPC players are experiencing \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes. We\u2019re continuing to work on a permanent solution to this with our friends and partners at Nvidia. We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue.\nPlayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in Contracts Mode.\nThe Summer Suave Suit (Hot Summer) does not count as a \u2018suit\u2019 with regards to challenges and Contracts Mode.\nA gate to the Upside Down can be found when opening the door to the break room in the Bank. We\u2019re consulting with Hawkins PD on a possible fix.\nArea Discovery challenges, in some particular edge cases, do not unlock properly.\nThe SA rating can still be earned when the body of a target who has been tranquilized and then killed immediately afterwards has been found.\nThe SA rating is lost when a body, that has been KO\u2019d as the result of an accident, is found.\nFire extinguishers no longer explode when an explosive is detonated on them.\n\u2018Hold my Hair\u2019 challenges are difficult to complete due to emetic posion causing NPCs to find the nearest trashcan (rubbish bin) instead of a toilet.\n\nPost-release Known Issues\n\nThere is a high probability that PS4 players (PS4 Pro is not affected) who equip both new items from the Smart Casual Pack (IO Elite S2VP Earphones and ICA Flash Phone) in their loadout at the same time when loading a Legacy mission will crash the game. This issue only occurs during a \u2018fresh\u2019 load of the map, so a current workaround is to start the mission without these two items and then \u201cReplan Mission\u201d and equip them. We are already working on a fix and expect it to be released in the September Update.\n\n\n\n\nAugust Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nThe August Game Update isn\u2019t the end of the content for this month, The Gunrunner will wrap up the month when he arrives on August 30. Stay tuned for more updates about what\u2019s lined up in September on our next IOI Monthly livestream. In a change to our scheduled programming, that episode will now go live on September 2nd.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-august-update/"},

For now, we\u2019ve some character bios for each target. Know your enemy.\nRoman Khabko\n\nNot much is known about Khabko\u2019s youth although it is believed that his name is an alias assumed in the late 80\u2019s while he worked for a Russian mobster in New York. It was there that he made a name for himself and rose through the ranks of the American arm of the Russian Mafia. He left the country after a drug deal went sour and for DEA agents were left dead at the scene.\nBack in Russia, Khabko was involved in human trafficking and his clientele became the top tier of political aspirants, diplomats and high-ranking politicians. Eventually, he oversteps his boundaries and blackmails an important diplomat, resulting in his arrest. He is placed at the remote, privately-run Perm-14 facility and has been there for a decade.\nHowever, he dreams of returning to warmer climates and has pooled his remaining wealth to offer $10M USD to the prisons warden, Vitaly Reznikov to help him escape.\nVitaly Reznikov\n\nA former KGB operative who worked on exposing foreign spies, Reznikov travelled most of the Soviet Union and made friends and enemies in all places. He was given a ranking position within the FSB after saving the life of a high-ranking KGB officer. It was at the FSB that he discovered several abandoned facilities in Siberia and pulled some strings to assume control of them.\nOver the next several years, Reznikov rebuilt the facilities as prisons and would eventually host some of the state\u2019s most controversial prisoners. Reports of abuse, disappearances and corruption started trickling out of the Perm-14 facility and rumours persist that Reznikov lets high-ranking prisoners leave if they pay enough.\nNow, Reznikov fears investigation by the UN Human Rights Council and has decided to play his last gambit and accept a multimillion dollar bribe from the Russian Mobster to facilitate his escape.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLAUNCH TRAILER\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWant to see the location for yourself?

There\u2019s plenty more to look forward to as we move towards the end of the month, including Contracts Mode in Hawke\u2019s Bay and the long-awaited Anniversary Suits!\nGet the full rundown of everything that\u2019s arriving in July through our dedicated July Roadmap blog post.\n\u00a0\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-siberia/"},
{"title": "HITMAN 2 \u2013 July Update", "date": "July 29, 2019", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u201cWelcome to Siberia, 47.\u201d\nThe headline act of the HITMAN 2 July Update is a brand new map in the Sniper Assassin mode for Expansion Pass owners. 47 will be travelling to the Perm-14 prison facility to eliminate new targets and unlock a new rifle that can be used in all locations.\nFor all other players, we are adding Hawke\u2019s Bay to Contracts Mode AND we\u2019re (finally!) giving all players the opportunity to use three iconic disguises \u2013 one from each of IOI\u2019s iconic previous titles. On top of all that, there are some quality-of-life fixes and tweaks coming your way. Details inbound.\n\n\n\nRelease Details and Server Maintenance\nThe July Update (aka 2.50) will arrive on July 30 and we expect it to be approximately 1.7 GB on consoles and 850 MB on PC. There will be server maintenance at the usual times between 11:00 and 15:00 UTC to prepare for this release. Stay tuned to the @IOInteractive Twitter page for updates.\nPlease be aware that the in-game version numbering (2.50) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0\nNote: This update will be required for all players and will include the fixes and improvements listed in the Game Update section below. Owners of the Expansion Pass will need to download the Siberia Sniper Assassin map separately from their platform store.\n\n\n\nExpansion Pass Content Release Details\nOwners of the Expansion Pass will be able to download the new Sniper Assassin map from their platform stores starting on July 30. We recommend that you always search for it directly on the platform store and download the content from there.\n\u201cHITMAN 2 \u2013 Siberia\u201d is the Prison and will clock in at under 2 GB on all platforms.\nThe release time for this location will vary depending on your platform and region. Here is a full list of the release times for the new map and when you can begin downloading.\nJuly 30th\nXbox One (Global) 13:00 UTC\nPS4 (Europe) 13:00 UTC\nPS4 (North America) 15:00 UTC\nPC (Global) 17:00 UTC\nJuly 31st\nPS4 (Asia) 03:00 UTC\nPS4 (Japan) 03:00 UTC\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Update 2.50: What\u2019s NEW?\nSniper Assassin Map: Siberia (Expansion Pass)\nAgent 47\u2019s latest long-range mission takes him to one of the harshest climates on the planet, where he must eliminate two targets and start a prison riot to cover his tracks.\nThe mission name for this location is \u2018Crime and Punishment\u2019 and will include new trophies and achievements to earn. Agent 47\u2019s rifle for this mission, ICA Druzhina 34 Arctic, can also be unlocked for use in all sandbox locations.\n\n\n\n\nContracts Mode in Hawke\u2019s Bay\nWe\u2019re adding Hawke\u2019s Bay to your options for Contracts Mode. Create your own missions by tagging targets and setting the complications and requirements for others. Have fun!\n\n\nAnniversary Suits\nCelebrate 20 years of IOI with these suits inspired by characters from our previous games; Futo, Lynch and Christoper Stone (The Freedom Phantom).\nPreviously exclusive to the HITMAN: Definitive Edition, these in-game suits will be be available in HITMAN 2 for anyone who signs up for a free IOI Account.\nYou can sign up for an account either through the game itself, or via the website. Once you\u2019ve done that, link your game and the suits will be added to your inventory the next time you launch HITMAN 2. If you already have an IOI Account, you\u2019ll get the suits when you next play the game \ud83d\ude42\n\nToggle Aim\nAfter player feedback, we have added the option to choose whether you hold or toggle the aim button. By default, the option will be set to Hold to Aim (how it has always been) but can be changed to Toggle Aim in the Options&gt;Gameplay&gt;Weapon Aim menu. This option affects aiming with guns and rifles (including Sniper Assassin mode) but does not affect 47\u2019s \u2018aiming\u2019 when throwing; this will still require the play to hold the button to move 47\u2019s throwing arc.\n\u00a0\n\n\nGame Update 2.50: What\u2019s Changing?\n\nCamera Grids\nA few months back, we made a change where security camera grids were always visible. We\u2019ve now added this as a setting in the Options&gt;Gameplay&gt;Camera Grid menu. This will be set to \u2018On\u2019 by default but can also be changed to \u2018Off\u2019.\u00a0When the setting is \u2018On\u2019, camera grids will always be shown whether in Instinct or not. When set to \u2018Off\u2019, camera grids will only be shown when in Instinct.\nIllegal HUD Prompts\nWe\u2019ve made a visual change to alert players when they are about to pick up an illegal item or perform an illegal action. Previously, there would be a small red exclamation point attached to the interaction button. Now, we have added a slightly larger exclamation point next to the interaction button and we\u2019ve made the interaction circle turn red (rather than white) when performing the action. The ambition with these two small tweaks is to make it more apparent to players that they are about to perform an action that is illegal.\nIn the image below, you can see that the exclamation mark is easier to identify and that the interaction circle fills with red when the interaction button is pressed down.\n\n\n\nStash Icon\nWe\u2019ve added a small visual change to the Stash Points in-game (e.g trash cans) that will show a subtle icon to indicate to players that an item has been stashed there. Currently, each Stash Point has the interaction marker (small white square) that indicates that you can interact with an item. Now, that interaction marker will be \u2018filled in\u2019 to indicate that an item is stashed there.\nIn the example below, it is now easier to see that an item is stashed in the trash can (the icon is filled in), but there is nothing in the briefcase (icon is empty).\n\nAttention Spike\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made three subtle changes to the Attention Meter to make it easier to know when you are gaining attention and how close you are to becoming compromised or spotted.\nFirstly, we\u2019ve made a change to the colour. Yellow is the new white and makes it easier to see.\nSecondly, the meter will now \u2018fill\u2019 allowing you to see how close you are to being spotted.\nThirdly, we\u2019ve made a technical change to the attention meter to prevent it from not being visible on-screen. It was previously a 3D object in the world and in some cases, depending on where the camera was positioned, it wasn\u2019t visible to the player.\nIn the (zoomed) image below, you can see the new colour showing how much attention has been gained. The slightly faded yellow shows how much room there is for more attention before the guard will react.\n\n\nWho is THAT?\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Diana, Agent 47\u2019s handler, would not introduce targets (and key objectives) in some missions. She will now do so again in her trademark style. However, we\u2019ve made a small tweak to give her a few days off every so often. Now, after hearing Diana introduce a target (or key objective) once, she won\u2019t introduce that particular target again for a period of 48 hours real-time. We expect that this change will make Diana\u2019s dialogue less intrusive for repeated playthroughs over a short period of time and make her less of a meme, whilst maintaining her impact and assistance to 47. Note: Key Objectives include things such as the virus in Sapienza, Soders\u2019 heart in Hokkaido, etc.\nSA KO OH NO\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the Silent Assassin rating would be lost if a target was knocked unconscious, killed in an accident and THEN the body was found.\nSA RULES #2\nWe\u2019ve addressed an issue where the Silent Assassin rating could be earned with 4 stars because the \u2018Never Spotted\u2019 bonus was sometimes not being granted after a SA playthrough. Now, the SA rating and all bonuses should be properly awarded after completing a SA playthrough. This was sometimes caused by 47 being almost/partially noticed by a target before killing them.\nTweaked Assignments\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that was preventing Blair Reddington from completing the entirety of his loop in Embrace of the Serpent. He was skipping two specific steps that also meant that dialogue was not being triggered. Part of this fix included Blair triggering the correct dialogue, depending on the status of the chef.\nBank Chatter\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in New York (The Bank) where two conversations could overlap in the Conference Room.\nTime\u2019s Up\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u2018Time\u2019s Up\u2019 Challenge in New York (The Bank) would not always unlock correctly.\nLights Out\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the chandelier in the main hall of the Bank would \u2018flicker\u2019 and temporarily disappear after being destroyed.\nBank Cover\nWe\u2019ve fixed some issues with 47 taking cover near the staircase to the CEO\u2019s floor in The Bank.\nShot Gun\nWe\u2019ve addressed an issue where the Sawed Off Bartoli 12G Shotgun (New York Mastery Unlock) could not be equipped as a starting weapon or placed in an Agency Pickup. The shotgun can now be used in those ways. However, it can no longer be holstered during gameplay and will instead function like all other shotguns in terms of being placed on 47\u2019s back. To support these changes, we\u2019ve altered the description of the weapon and renamed it to the \u201cCustomised Bartoli 12G\u201d.\nUpdate: This change is temporary and was inadvertently included as part of our investigations into how we could make the weapon work properly with weapon stashes. With our next update (August), we will revert the weapon\u2019s name and holster-ability (yes, that\u2019s a word) as well as enabling it to be placed in large stash points.\nHalf-Baked Hippo\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Jorge Franco would sometimes suspend his routine during the \u2018Half Baked\u2019 Mission Story.\nLocked Closet\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where 47 could not exit a specific closet in the Crows Hideout in Mumbai. If you\u2019re not happy with this fix, you can still enter the cupboard and refuse to leave.\nTaxi Exit\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where player-made Contracts created in Mumbai can be insta-failed if the \u201cRequired Exit\u201d is set to a taxi driver who is then distracted or affected by combat.\nMuffin Melee\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where muffins and snowballs were categorised as Gear. They are now correctly placed in the \u2018Weapons \u2013 Melee\u2019 category.\nA Quick Fix\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u201cNo Evidence\u201d challenges would not be completed when players exited a mission, despite fulfilling the requirements. Once cause for this was immediately exiting the mission after eliminating a target. We\u2019ve made it so that a fast-exit will still grant the challenge when the requirements are met.\nNote: See the Known Issues below for an outstanding \u2018No Evidence\u2019 issue.\nLost Items\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where thrown items could get stuck out of reach in certain ceilings in Mumbai. Thrown items would cause NPC\u2019s to investigate the noise in the room above.\nRoadmap? Jeppe!\nWe\u2019ve added an option to the Featured Hub to allow players to view the newest monthly Roadmap. This will function as a one-time pop-up message when a new Roadmap is released each month and will give the option to visit our website (this one right here!) to get more details. It will then be a permanent fixture in the Featured Hub so that it can be reviewed and admired at any time.\nPress P for Patch Notes\nWe\u2019ve added a \u2018hard button\u2019 at the very bottom of the Options menu that will take you to our latest Release Notes / Patch Notes. If you\u2019re reading this after pressing that button, you probably just found out about that.\nBusted (Legacy)\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where 47 was unable to pick up the bust in the storage room in Paris.\nStep Up (Legacy)\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue in Bangkok where Agent 47 would not be trespassing on a specific step in the staircase between the lounge and the kitchen.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPC-Specific Fixes\nSSAO\nThe \u2018SSAO\u2019 setting now has more options to select. Previously, this setting had two options; on or off. Now it has six options; Off, Minimum, Low, Medium, High and Ultra. These can be set in-game or via the Launcher.\nHotfix 2.5.2\nWe\u2019ve released a hotfix for PC players today (August 1st) that fixes two issues we saw as a result of our 2.5.0 release earlier this week. Here\u2019s what has changed:\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the game could crash when changing the \u2018challenge view filter\u2019 on a Destination page in the menu.\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where adjusting the SSAO Quality settings might not have any in-game effect, i.e you could not see a difference between \u2018Medium\u2019 and \u2018Ultra\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\u00a0\nTo save us from writing it repeatedly, \u201cWe are aware of an issue where\u2026\u201d\n\nPC players are experiencing \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes. We\u2019re continuing to work on a permanent solution to this with our friends and partners at Nvidia. We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue.\nPlayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in Contracts Mode.\nPlayers cannot unlock the \u2018Janbiya\u2019 from the House Built on Sand mission (Legacy Pack)\nThe \u2018No Evidence\u2019 challenge will not be earned if a sedated body is found.\nThe Summer Suave Suit (Hot Summer) does not count as a \u2018suit\u2019 with regards to challenges and Contracts Mode.\nThe \u2018Sniper Assassin\u2019 challenge in sandbox missions do not unlock if the target spots 47 before he kills them, conflicting with current SA rules.\nAthena Savalas can get distracted *just* before falling to her death.\nA gate to the Upside Down can be found when opening the door to the break room in the Bank. We\u2019re consulting with Hawkins PD on a possible fix.\nArea Discovery challenges, in some particular edge cases, do not unlock properly.\nPlayers are unable to unlock the achievement / trophy for reaching Bangkok mastery level 20 in certain circumstances.\nThe SA rating can still be earned when the body of a target who has been tranquilised and then killed immediately afterwards has been found.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nJuly Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nThe July Game Update concludes the content for this month.

For now, we\u2019ve got a full character bio for the mission\u2019s target to prepare you for what\u2019s to come.\nAthena Savalas\n\nThe Director of the New York branch of the banking division of financial giant Milton-Fitzpatrick, Miss Savalas is an extremely hard-working, entirely unscrupulous woman who gave up everything personal to succeed in her life as a high-tier banker.\nAn heir to a logistics empire, Athena Savalas entered the male-dominated banking system fresh out of business school. She quickly learned that to succeed, she would need to transform herself entirely from the classic businesswoman she\u2019d been bred to become. Savalas developed a harshness and cut-throat approach to her co-workers, which alienated her from personal relationships at the bank as well as in her private life.\nNow, at the age of 51, Athena Savalas\u2019 transformation is complete. The fair-skinned girl with the bright blue eyes and warm smile has been replaced by an impossibly white creature of infinite sternness who is always in complete control. Savalas is a marble statue at this point, having shed every original bit of herself with every year that she\u2019s worked in finance. She\u2019s an expert at finding loop holes, exploiting tax rules and laundering money for criminals and has been involved in numerous tax evasion schemes, which have earned her multiple \u201cBanker of the Year\u201d awards in the last decade.\nOver the years, Savalas has also developed a refined disdain for the middle class, reducing customers to numbers on sheets of paper with no thought to the things she destroys with her constant \u201cless is more\u201d approach to small and medium-sized businesses. Rumors of wanton gambling with client money and the bank\u2019s finances are beginning to catch up to her and with the board of directors looking for a new CEO of Milton-Fitzpatrick, Savalas is eagerly covering her tracks, using any means necessary.\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLAUNCH TRAILER\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe Bank is out now and here is the new launch trailer!\nIt was just debuted on the IOI Monthly live stream and this glorious trailer will show you more of The Bank and introduce you to some of the key characters and opportunities that you\u2019ll encounter.\n\n\u00a0\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tBRIEFING VIDEO\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe excitement of experiencing a new Hitman level for the first time starts with the briefing video.

Contracts Mode support has also been added, include the ability to create and search for Contracts in New York. New trophies and achievements have also been added for the new location. (You must have access to the New York location to access this content and earn the trophies / achievements)\nReload HUD\nWe\u2019ve added a new element to the HUD that will inform players when their weapon needs to be reloaded. The Reload HUD appears for a few seconds in the centre of the screen and will flash yellow with 1 shot left in the magazine and red when the magazine is empty.\nThe Reload HUD can be toggled to Full (default), Minimal or Off in the Gameplay Settings.\nWhen set to Full, the reload indicator will appear in the centre of the screen before moving to the weapon HUD (bottom right).\nWhen set to Minimal, the reload indicator will only appear in the weapon HUD.\nWhen it\u2019s off, it\u2019s off. Except in Sniper Assassin Mode, where the Reload HUD is always active.\nNote: The red warning will remain active for Sniper rifles when scoped/zoomed.\nSilent Assassin Inconsistencies\nWe\u2019ve fixed some issues with inconsistencies relating to the Silent Assassin tracker, scoring, XP awards and challenge unlocks. For example, some cases of an NPC discovering a target killed by an accident would result in the Silent Assassin rating being awarded only in the \u2018Detailed View\u2019 yet any related XP awards and challenges would not be unlocked. This change should make everything consistent.\nChallenge Types\nWe\u2019ve moved all 5 Assassination Challenges that were previously included under the \u2018Feats\u2019 category and moved them to the \u2018Assassination\u2019 category instead. The specific challenges are Tasteless, Traceless, Hold My Hair, Someone Could Hurt Themselves, Piano Man and Straight Shot.\nLanguage Barriers\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue in the game\u2019s menu where certain location names were illegible when using Italian, Polish or Spanish language settings.\nFlying Fish\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where a fish would appear swimming through the air in the Miami Parking Garage after approximately 7 minutes. Players will now have to wait for 7 hours for the fish to appear.\u00a0\nSwimming Mode\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue that could cause 47 to go \u2018swimming\u2019 in Whittleton Creek. More specifically, it was possible to leave the playing space and have 47 end up in the river.\u00a0\nGardening Work\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause a tree to be floating in mid-air on the Himmelstein Sniper Assassin map.\nBody Discovery: Off\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause NPC\u2019s to be unable to see bodies that were dumped over a specific ledge in Miami. We\u2019ve offered some of them laser eye surgery and expect them to feature in a future set of release notes when they can see 47 through a wall.\nLosing the Spark\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the Disposable Scrambler does not emit any sound when being used on a locked door.\nSMG \u2013 S\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue where the TAC-SMG S was missing the final \u2018S\u2019 in various places.\u00a0\nSuite Typos\nWe\u2019ve fixed a few community-reported typos in the descriptions for the Black Winter Suit and Midnight Black Suit.\nLegacy: Club 27 Master\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that was preventing the \u2018Suit Only\u2019 Challenge from unlocking on Casual or Professional Difficulties after players had successfully completed the challenge on Master Difficulty.\nLegacy: Writers Block\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in The Author from the Patient Zero campaign that could cause 47 to be stuck \u2018blending in\u2019 at the start of the mission if the cutscene was skipped.\nLegacy: Low Lighting\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in The Icon where beams of light were coming from lamps that were turned off.\nCredit Where It\u2019s Due\nWe\u2019ve updated the HITMAN 2 credits to include the names of people that have worked on the game since its launch in November 2018. These updates include new employees and contributors that have worked on the post-launch live content.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost Mode Improvements\nTarget Spawn\nWe\u2019ve fixed a community-reported issue in Santa Fortuna Ghost Mode where consecutive targets could spawn in identical or nearby locations.\nConnection Stability\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause players to get stuck in a loading loop under certain circumstances.\n\u00a0\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\nTo save us from writing it repeatedly, \u201cWe are aware of an issue where\u2026\u201d\n\nPC players are experiencing \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes. We\u2019re continuing to work on a permanent solution to this with our friends and partners at Nvidia. We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue.\nPlayers can encounter problems when dropping items needed for specific exits in Contracts Mode.\nDiana doesn\u2019t always introduce a target in that trademark way of hers. We\u2019re working on a solution.\n47 can get stuck in a specific wardrobe in Mumbai in the Crows Hideout near the stairs. If you enter the wardrobe, you won\u2019t be able to get out again.\nContracts created in Mumbai can be insta-failed if the \u201cRequired Exit\u201d is set to a taxi driver who is then distracted or affected by combat.\nThe SA rating might not be awarded if 47 is almost/partially noticed by a target before killing them.\nThe SA rating can be sometimes still be achieved after a KO\u2019d body is found or a target is killed with a noticed kill.\nMuffins and Snowballs are categorised as weapons, rather than melee items.\nExtra: We received player feedback that an option to toggle the aiming mode would be appreciated. We will add the option in a future update.\n\n\n\n\nJune Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nThe June Game Update concludes the content for this month. Stay tuned for more updates about what\u2019s lined up in July.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-june-update/"},

The latest edition of the world\u2019s best-selling gaming annual from the global authority of record breaking will be be available in September 2019 and feature the latest and greatest records from hundreds of games.\n\nToday, we are happy to announce just one of the records that you can read about later this year. Mendietinha, a well-known Hitman community member, will be officially recognised as a Guinness World Records\u2122 Title holder for his completion of HITMAN 2\u2019s first Elusive Target; \u2018The Undying\u2019. An official certificate and a copy of the book will be sent out to Brazil for Mendie when it is released later this year.\nWe\u2019re very happy to be the first to say \u2013 CONGRATULATIONS MENDIE!\nYou can send your own messages of congratulations his way on Twitter or Twitch.\nMendie eliminated Mark Faba, completed the contract in 38 seconds and managed to earn the coveted Silent Assassin rating, whilst also exiting the mission in style; riding on the back of a dolphin whilst dressed as a clown. All in all, it was a creative and fast completion that couldn\u2019t be bested on any platform.\n\nThe Undying was the first Elusive Target for HITMAN 2 and included the talents of Hollywood actor Sean Bean in the role of Mark Faba. Elusive Targets are time-limited, high pressure contracts where players only have one chance to perform and death is permanent \u2013 for both the target and Agent 47. During the contracts activation period of 10 days, starting on November 20, Mendie topped the PC leaderboard and had the fastest time across all available platforms.\nHere\u2019s exactly how Mendie managed to complete his successful playthrough:\n\nWe would also like to acknowledge that this record is specifically for the first Elusive Target for HITMAN 2 titled \u2018The Undying\u2019. Since this record was formalised, we have released another Elusive Target titled \u2018The Undying Returns\u2019, which has been completed in 26 seconds. Whilst the contracts are similar, the HITMAN 2 entries for the Guinness World Records Gamer\u2019s Edition 2020 are focused on the original \u2018The Undying\u2019 contract.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/the-undying-world-record/"},

The impact of these improvements will vary from player to player.\nLegacy: Cheveyo Calibration\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where completing the Cheveyo Calibration Escalation would cause the game to disconnect from the server.

Stay tuned for more updates about what\u2019s lined up in June.\nNote that there\u2019s been a change to the scheduling and \u2018The Deceivers\u2019 have been moved to a June 7th release, with the \u2018Muffin Man\u2019 Challenge Pack taking its place on 28th May.

{"title": "HITMAN 2 \u2013 April Update", "date": "April 30, 2019", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe HITMAN 2 April Update includes a major update for Ghost Mode, changes to how the Silent Assassin rating is achieved, a Silent Assassin Tracker, quality of life changes, menu tweaks and bug fixes. Many of the fixes and changes that were included in this update were reported by our players and community. We\u2019d like to thank everyone who reported, upvoted or discussed these changes.\n\n\n\nRelease Details and Server Maintenance\nThe April Update (aka 2.21) will arrive on April 30 and we expect it to be approximately 1.7 GB on consoles and 1.1 GB on PC. There will be server maintenance between 11:00 and 14:00 UTC to prepare for this release. \nPlease be aware that the in-game version numbering (2.21) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0\n\nGame Update 2.21: What\u2019s NEW?\nGhost Mode Location: Santa Fortuna\nOur second location for Ghost Mode is Santa Fortuna. Welcome to the jungle.\n\n\n\nGhost Mode: Emotes\nWe\u2019ve added 4 new emotes that can be activated in Ghost Mode.\n\n\nHow Gracious \u2013 For those moments when a kiss speaks louder than words\nWell Done \u2013 A slightly ironic clapping gesture aimed at your opponent\nEvil Eye \u2013 Let your opponent understand they\u2019re under severe scrutiny\nDisbelief \u2013 Show appreciation of your opponent\u2019s actions by shaking your head\nGhost Mode: Items\nWe\u2019ve added 4 new items to Ghost Mode. Pick them up in Ghost Crates.\n\n\nThe Ghost Freeze Grenade will slow down your opponent for a short amount of time.\nThe Ghost Outfit Manipulator will simultaneously change both your and your opponents outfit to a new random one.\nThe Ghost Proximity Explosive will trigger in your opponents world if they come near it.\nThe Ghost Flash Grenade will blind and disorientate your opponent.\nGhost Mode: Phantom\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve added the \u2018Phantom Assassin\u2019 Challenge to Ghost Mode. Complete it by eliminating 100 targets in Ghost Mode (any location) and unlock the Phantom Suit.\nGhost Mode: Target Variation\nWe\u2019ve added 4 new variations of the Ghost Mode target, for a total of 5. Whilst keeping the same visual style, the targets will now have more variation in their appearance. It doesn\u2019t matter what they look like if you want to unlock the Phantom Suit though, just eliminate 100.\nGhost Mode: Rematch\nWe\u2019ve added the option to immediately go into a rematch with the same opponent.\nSilent Assassin Scoring\nWe\u2019ve implemented new and finalised rules for earning the Silent Assassin rating. Our goals for this rating is to keep it as the pinnacle accomplishment for the game, where earning 5 stars and the highest possible score was something to aspire to and difficult to achieve.\n\nThe mission scoring will now be calculated based on these parameters; Objectives Complete (20k), Never Spotted (20k), No Noticed Kills (20k), No Bodies Found (20k), No Recordings (20k), Non-Target Kill Penalty (0), Time Bonus.\nTo earn the Silent Assassin rating in any mission, players will need to complete all objectives and exit the mission, without\u00a0any of the following 7 events occurring:\n1. An NPC escalates to the Compromised state.\n2. An NPC escalates to the Suspicious state.\n3. An NPC catches Agent 47 trespassing.\n4. An NPC finds a dead or pacified body. (Accident kills and poision kills do not fail this event)\n5. Agent 47 is spotted performing an illegal or suspicious action through a camera by an NPC. (If there is no guard watching the camera feed, 47 will get recorded but can still earn the SA rating by destroying the evidence.)\n6. Getting recorded by a security camera and failing to destroy the evidence.\n7. Agent 47 kills a non-target.\nAdditional: For events 1-5, if the NPC that triggers the event is a target (and no other non-targets trigger the same event or gains knowledge from the target), the SA rating will be retained on mission end.\n\n\nSilent Assassin Tracker\nKeep track of your status towards the Silent Assassin rating during gameplay. The tracker will display as an icon next to the mini map and the colour will show whether SA will currently be awarded for the playthrough. In cases where SA is not currently achievable but could be later on, for example if Agent 47 was recorded by a security camera, the tracker will display as red and then turn to green once the evidence has been deleted.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame Update 2.21: What\u2019s Changing?\n\n\n\nNot SA Fast\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could prevent the Silent Assassin rating from being awarded to players who exit a mission immediately after killing the final target.\nMenu Toggle\nWe\u2019ve changed our ON/OFF menu option selector to be a toggle instead. You\u2019ll still see the old system for some HDR options but we\u2019ll update those in a coming update.\u00a0\nNamed Targets\nWe\u2019ve removed the target names from displaying on the mini map to make it easier to read, especially when multiple targets are close together.\nCareer Inventory Categories\nWe\u2019ve added categories to the Career Inventory page to make it easier to scroll through your items. This works in the same way as the recent update to the loadout menu.\nCareer Statistics Categories\nWe\u2019ve added categories to the Career Statistics page to split HITMAN and HITMAN 2. This will allow players to get to the preferred destination quicker and have a per-game overview of their progress.\nLeaderboard Alignment\nWe\u2019ve made a minor visual change to how the leaderboard scores are displayed, so that the numerical scores are all aligned. This will make them easier to read and compare at a glance.\nFeatured Contracts Challenge Images\nWe\u2019ve adjusted the images of the Featured Contract Challenges to better represent the award that is unlocked for completing them.\nSieger Subsonic\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the \u2018Subsonic\u2019 perk on the Sieger 300 Ghost Sniper Rifle was alerting nearby NPC\u2019s.\nCamera Grids\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where laser grids from Security Cameras were not displayed on Professional Difficulty\nMartinez Vision\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Santa Fortuna where NPC\u2019s could see bodies on the balcony when entering Andrea\u2019s mansion through the front door.\nCar Battery\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the car battery to be non-functional and only \u2018active\u2019 immediately after being shot, rather than remaining active until it killed someone.\u00a0\nBullet Blend\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Agent 47 would not be removed from a blending spot after NPCs become suspicious of him. This could lead to 47 reading a newspaper whilst guards peppered him endlessly with bullets. Whilst it made for some nice Reddit posts, we still wanted to fix it.\nPigeon Loop\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Whittleton Creek where pigeons that had previously been killed, would respawn when loading the game. Now, the pigeons will stay dead.\nStore Menu\nWe\u2019ve changed the images for each store item to better illustrate what\u2019s included. We\u2019ve also changed where the PS4 \u2018get access\u2019 links lead to make it easier to make a purchase choice.\nLegacy: Concussion Crisis\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause various issues when exploding a concussion device near the destructible wall between the beach and the lab in Sapienza.\nLegacy: Paris Briefcase\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause 47 to hold his briefcase in an unusual way when using the Pile-Driver Barge Starting Location in Paris.\nLegacy: Photobomb\nWe\u2019ve made some back-end changes and simplified the unlock requirements for this challenge.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nLocalisation Sweep\nWe\u2019ve fixed various localisation inconsistencies throughout HITMAN 2 and the Legacy Pack.\nCrash Sweep\nWe\u2019ve fixed a number of one-time or frequent crashes across multiple situations and circumstances.\n\n\n\nGhost Mode Improvements\nLobby Redesign\nWith the addition of Santa Fortuna, we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to redesign the Ghost Mode Lobby. \u2018Quick Match\u2019 will search for a match on all available locations, \u2018Featured Match\u2019 will search for a match on Santa Fortuna and \u2018Invite Player\u2019 will allow you to select from either \u2018Random Map\u2019 or specify which match you want to play.\nGhost Icon\nWe\u2019ve updated the icon that is used for the Ghost Item Crate to make it easier to differentiate from the Weapons Crate.\nGhost Effect\nWe\u2019ve added a \u2018Ghost Effect\u2122\u2019 to the Ghost items in the inventory to make it easier to see them at a glance and tell them apart from similar items.\nGhost Labels\nWe\u2019ve added a \u2018Ghost Item\u2019 label to all Ghost items in the inventory to make it even easier to see them at a glance and tell them apart from similar items.\nGhost Challenges\nWe\u2019ve moved the Ghost Mode challenges to their own category, and out of Miami. You\u2019re welcome, completionists.\u00a0\nThe Loading Tip\nWe\u2019ve added new loading tips that include the new emotes and Ghost Items.\nGhost Rules\nWe\u2019ve added the Fibre Wire and Lethal Syringe into the Ghost Crate options for Miami and Santa Fortuna to fix an issue that was preventing the \u2018Piano Man\u2019 and \u2018Tasteless, traceless\u2019 challenges from being completed in Ghost Mode.\nGhost Rules\nWe\u2019ve fixed a typographic error in the Ghost Mode Rules where we mistakenly wrote \u2018loose\u2019 instead of \u2018lose\u2019. Thanks to the hundreds of players that have told us about this error, we won\u2019t make it again.\nGhost SFX\nWe\u2019ve added new sound effects to the Ghost Mode results screen, depending on whether you win or loose.\nGhost Block\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause Agent 47 to be blocked/stuck when respawning in Ghost Mode.\nEmote Support\nEmotes are activated by pressing \u2018left\u2019 on the d-pad by default. As a result, pressing \u2018right\u2019 on the d-pad now activates the item inventory. An option called \u2018Invert Inventory\u2019 has been added that will flip these options around and allow you to press \u2018left\u2019 to activate your item inventory. On PC, a new binding for Emotes has been added and can be changed as needed.\n\u00a0\n\nPC-Specific Improvements\nDynamic Sharpening\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause a black outline to form around specular highlights on water surfaces when the \u2018Dynamic Sharpening\u2019 option was set to anything other than \u2018OFF\u2019.\nTexture Filtering\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the Texture Filtering settings were not working in DX12.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\n\nWe are aware that PC players are still experiencing issues with \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes. We\u2019re continuing to work on a permanent solution to this with our friends and partners at Nvidia. We recommend that players who have been experiencing this issue use DX12, as this has been reported to fix the issue.\nWe are aware of an issue in the Hantu Port Sniper Assassin map where players can get stuck in the level if the immediately skip the outro cinematic.\nWe are aware of an issue that can prevent the target icons being displayed on the minimap, based on selected HUD settings.\nWe are aware of two separate issues in Mumbai where NPC\u2019s can see 47 through walls in the trainyard and the bathroom near Rangan\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n\nApril Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\nThe April Game Update concludes the content for this month.

(These changes have been included in the 2.20 release for PC players.)\n\nGame Update 2.20: What\u2019s NEW?\nHantu Port Location (Expansion Pass)\nThe first major content drop for our Expansion Pass is a brand new Sniper Assassin map in Hantu Port, Singapore.\n\n\n\n\nHantu Port\nWe\u2019ve added 7 new trophies/ achievements for the Hantu Port Sniper Assassin map.\n\n\nHantu Support\nWe\u2019ve updated the menu flow for the Game Modes section, including new artwork and backgrounds for single player and multiplayer selection. Hantu Port has also been added to the Career Page.\nSniper Career\nWe\u2019ve added the Himmelstein and Hantu Port locations to the Career/Statistics menu. The progression of each of the 3 rifles will be displayed (47, Stone and Knight).\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame Update 2.20: What\u2019s Changing?\n\n\n\nNul Point\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could result in a successful playthrough ending with a \u20180\u2019 score.\nStatic Rico\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause Rico Delgado to suspend his routine after the tattoo was finished.\nTexture Fix\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause textures to flicker during the Three-Headed Serpent mission in Santa Fortuna.\nBackpacker Bug\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could fail the \u2018Backpacker\u2019 Mission Story after placing the souvenir.\nShashka A33 Audio\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the Shashka A33 rifle to have barely audible SFX when used by an NPC.\u00a0\nBrief Case\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where 47 getting frisked with the briefcase could result in an animation where the briefcase clips through 47\u2019s legs.\nWrench Stash\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that prevented the Handyman Wrench from being used in a \u2018Hidden Stash\u2019.\nDisco Crush\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that was preventing unconscious NPC\u2019s from dying when a disco ball was dropped on them.\nEnvironment\u00a0Sweep\nWe\u2019ve fixed multiple minor issues across all locations (including Legacy) relating to Environment Art.\nAmbient Array\nWe\u2019ve fixed various examples of ambient sound either being muted or not changing smoothly.\nWrench Hit\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that was preventing sound effects from triggering when pacifying an NPC with a wrench.\nArrived\nWe\u2019ve removed the Arrival \u2018location\u2019 from the Statistics page.\n\u00a0\n\nGhost Mode Improvements\nMap Areas\nWe\u2019ve enabled area names to the Ghost Mode map to help with navigation.\nStabile Ghost\nWe\u2019ve fixed a few issues that could cause crashes or infinite loads when entering a match.\nRandom First\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the first target in a match was not randomly selected.\n\u00a0\n\nPC-Specific Improvements\nDX 12\nWe\u2019ve enabled DX 12 support for all PC players using AMD and Intel DX12 GPUs and on NVIDIA GeForce 900 series or better. This option can be toggled in the Launcher.\nMotion Blur\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the Motion Blur setting was not working as intended.\nBenchmark Stats\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could prevent the results of the Benchmark being generated.\nMultiple Monitors\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause out-of-world environments to be visible for players using multiple monitors, or a single ultra-wide monitor.\u00a0\u00a0\nTaser Shot\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the ICA Proximity Taser would not react when being shot. Now, it will trigger as expected.\nStretched Outfits\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where outfits could become stretched on certain machines running Windows 8.1 with AMD graphics cards.\nPiP\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the PiP camera would sometimes display shadows erratically when the \u2018Screenspace Shadows\u2019 option is turned on.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n2.20.1 Hotfix Release Notes\nThis hotfix will release on March 27th for PS4 and Xbox One players.\u00a0These changes have already been included in the 2.20 release for PC players.\n\nSniper Shot Location Pt. 2\nIn the February Update, we rolled out changes to how NPC\u2019s react to weapon fire when they haven\u2019t seen 47 take the shot. Shortly after that release, we noticed that the change had highlighted some other issues with NPC reactions to weapon fire, which resulted in some unexpected AI behaviour. We\u2019ve now fixed all of those issues;\n\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause alerted guards or civilians to blame and compromise Agent 47 even though they had no knowledge of him committing a crime.\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could alert guards and civilians during the \u201cSearching\u201d status even when they are in areas that are not related to the ongoing \u2018search\u2019.\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause security cameras to become enforcers during the \u201cSearching\u201d status, even when they are in areas not related to the ongoing \u2018search\u2019. Security cameras can still enforce Agent 47 near the origin of an attack if he is detected during an ongoing \u2018search\u2019.\nWe\u2019ve improved the ability of guards to home in on the attack origin as soon as they figure out its whereabouts. In some cases, guards would instead remain idle, especially if the attack origin was hard to reach. The range of the attack affects the time it takes for a guard to estimate the approximate location of the attack origin.\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause guards that have recently stood down from combat to approach 47\u2019s location, even if they haven\u2019t seen him and shouldn\u2019t know where he is \u2013 such as if 47 didn\u2019t remain at the attack location.\n\nWe\u2019d like to acknowledge that is was very useful for us to use examples recorded and uploaded by our players to test, reproduce and ultimately fix these issues. We\u2019d also like to thank Ken Morgan for his contribution. RIP.\nNext Stop, Mumbai\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause Agent 47\u2019s outfit to be stretched when using specific starting locations in Mumbai.\nEarly SA Tracker\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that was causing the \u2018SA Tracker\u2019 to appear for some players, with no way to disable it. This feature was not intended to be released and we are aiming to release it fully in our next update. We\u2019ll say more about it then.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\n\nWe are aware that PC players are still experiencing issues with \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes. We\u2019re continuing to work on a solution to this with our friends and partners at Nvidia.\nThere are two known issues that can occur when using DX12:\n\nThe game can crash when loading the Colorado or Sapienza missions with 4K and HDR enabled. (20% repro rate)\nThe game can crash when using Alt-Tab with HDR enabled. (30%repro rate)\nFixes for both of these issues are in the works.\n\n\nWe are tracking and working on fixes for several other crash issues for all platforms.\nThere are some missing graphical elements on the Career Statistics page.\nIt is currently impossible to complete the \u2018Piano Man\u2019 and \u2018Tasteless, traceless\u2019 challenges in Ghost Mode due to the required items not being available in Ghost Crates. They will be reintroduced in a future update.\nSilent Assassin Status: We expect to release changes to how the Silent Assassin rating is awarded and calculated in our next major update. At that time, we\u2019ll detail the changes and conditions.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMarch Content Roadmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-march-update/"},

You\u2019ll have to figure out who is the real target and eliminate them to complete the mission. Don\u2019t worry if you also eliminate the body double, you won\u2019t fail the mission, but your rating will obviously take a hit.\nRead more about this contract in our dedicated The Politician blog post.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMarch 14 / Challenge Pack\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s always the butler\u2019s fault, right?

She will be in Hawke\u2019s Bay for 10 days starting on March 8.\n\nElusive Targets are the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created; a unique target that you\u2019ll only have one chance to eliminate. If you kill them or fail the contract, there will be no second chances. When you\u2019re playing the contract, the Elusive Target will not appear on the map and will not appear in Instinct. In order to find them, you\u2019ll need to use clues from the briefing video and remember what your target looks like. You\u2019ll need to explore, find your target, learn their patterns and come up with a plan to eliminate them \u2013 all whilst playing.\n\n\nMission Intelligence\nElusive Target: The Politican\nLocation: Hawke\u2019s Bay\nTarget: Dame Barbara Elizabeth Keating\nObjective: Eliminate Dame Barbara. (There are no special conditions for this contract.)\nDuration: Starts March 8th for 10 days.

Any suit that is unlocked can be used in the planning phase for any mission, giving you more options to use different suits throughout HITMAN 2.\nSpecial note: \u2018The Politician\u2019 Elusive Target in Hawke\u2019s Bay does not offer a direct unlock.\u00a0\nHowever, completing the contract will count towards your progress for unlocking the \u2018SA Suits\u2019 and \u2018Completion Suits\u2019 and most importantly of all \u2013 we are working on plans to give all players the chance to unlock an alternate version of the Hawke\u2019s Bay default starting suit; the Tactical Wetsuit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman2-et-politician/"},

{"title": "HITMAN 2 \u2013 February Update", "date": "February 25, 2019", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe HITMAN 2 February game update is just around the corner and brings quality of life changes, AI tweaks, menu updates and slight gameplay adjustments as well as bug fixes. We\u2019ve split the update into two sections this month to highlight what\u2019s new and changed, versus the outright bug fixes. \nWe also want to give a huge shout out to everyone in our community that has brought our attention to many of the changes and fixes in this update!\n\n\n\nRelease Details\nThe February Update (aka 2.14) will arrive on February 26 and we expect it to be approximately 1 GB on all platforms. The in-game version (2.14) might differ from the update name that is used by your console.\u00a0There will be server maintenance between 11:00 and 14:00 UTC.\u00a0\nPost-release Report\nAfter a successful release of the February Update (2.14) on February 26, we\u2019ve had two days to play the game ourselves on a retail build and gather some player feedback on the changes. Here\u2019s where we\u2019ll give a status update on some of the discussions we\u2019ve seen and the issues that have been found as a result of the recent update.\n\nArea Discovery: We know about issues regarding these challenges and we\u2019re working on rolling out a fix. We\u2019ll share more details soon.\n\nUpdate: A fix has been rolled out and we expect this issue to be resolved. Launch and complete a mission in the affected location to complete progress.\n\n\nSilent Assassin Tracker: Some players have seen that a new icon has appeared in the HUD. This wasn\u2019t\u00a0intended to be released in 2.14 and is an unfinished feature which might not work as expected and shouldn\u2019t be relied upon to properly track the Silent Assassin status. However, we do plan on releasing a finalised SA Tracker in a future update.\nCloth: We are aware of issues where 47\u2019s suit and cloth can appear to be stretched. We\u2019re working on a fix for this.\n\nUpdate: We have issued a fix for cloth issues on PC. These will be fixed in the March update on consoles.\n\n\nAdditional: We\u2019re tracking and investigating some issues regarding explosives opening doors and mission exit points. We\u2019re also gathering input on the \u2018Sniper Shot Location\u2019 change that we made. That will need a bit more time for us to analyse and compare the videos we\u2019re seeing from players and what we expect to happen.\n\n\nUpdate: We have some improvements in place for the Sniper Shot Location change ready for our next update in March.\n\n\nFeedback: We\u2019re continuing to track community feedback on the February Update.\n\n\nGame Update 2.14: What\u2019s NEW?\nLegacy Location Lighting\nWe\u2019ve made some lighting enhancements for the Legacy locations, including the HDR Adaptation, Colorgrading and Glow/Bloom settings. Here\u2019s what to expect:\n\nHigher Dynamic Range\nOverall Higher Contrast, providing a more detailed and dramatic image\nBetter controlled Bloom and Flare\nMinor tweaks to Sun and Sky colours and their relative intensity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory Loadout Sorting\nWe\u2019ve added Inventory Categories to make it easier to find and choose the items you want to take into a mission. Loadout selections will be sorted into tabs (Melee, explosives, etc) that can be individually selected.\nNPC KO\nWe\u2019ve changed the mini-map icon for an unconscious NPC. It was previously a white dot and looked too much like an Enforcer. Now, it mimics the HUD icon you see above an unconscious NPC in-game.\nSniper Shot Location\nWe\u2019ve made a change to how NPC\u2019s react to weapon fire when they haven\u2019t seen 47 take the shot. Previously, guards would (sometimes immediately) approach the location that the shot was taken from and search. They might also suppress that location with gunfire too. Now, they will start by searching at the place that the bullet landed and will start to figure out where the shot came from. They will only look at where the shot was fired from if they have line of sight to it. Depending on the circumstances, they may also suppress the location and begin to move towards it. It\u2019s important to note that 47 can only be compromised according to\u00a0the normal game rules: one of the NPCs should get close and spot\u00a0him near the location where the shot originated from and then they can link him to the crime.\nThe complexity of our game and it\u2019s various potential states makes it difficult to give a full explanation of all of the possible scenarios and reactions that could play out. However, we expect that this change will reduce any confusion about how and when 47 is spotted/compromised when engaging in long distances, especially the unfair feeling that the guards instantly know where 47 is after firing a shot.\nEMP Disarming\nWe\u2019ve made a change to how the Remote EMP Charge is disarmed. Previously, it could be activated/triggered whilst being carried by an NPC and would then be disarmed when the NPC \u2018secures\u2019 it in a weapons locker. Now, the EMP can be triggered at any point and will not be disarmed to allow for some more unique gameplay opportunities.\nChallenge Removal\nWe\u2019ve removed 3 Challenges from the Isle of Sgail; All The King\u2019s Men, Making Waves and No Budget For A Railing. After a sweep of the challenges in the game, we think that these particular challenges encourage the killing of multiple non-targets and they\u2019re not fun to complete. We\u2019ve also factored community feedback into the decision.\u00a0Players who have already unlocked these challenges will retain their XP and progression, but each challenge will be removed and the overall number of challenges will be reduced. (This was previously communicated to players on our Twitter account and the February Roadmap blog post.)\nSteady Aim\nWe\u2019ve added the Steady Aim trait back to the Silverballer and Silverballer Mk 2. We\u2019ve also reverted the menu images for these two guns back to silver.\nRubber Duck Detonator\nWe\u2019ve added a new HUD image for the Rubber Duck Detonator.\nMaster Mattias\nThe guard added in Master difficulty on the roof next to the Headmaster in Marrakesh is now a better guard. A tiny bit better.\nMeaty Bone\nWe\u2019ve added the Meaty Bone and Sacrifical Knife as options for the loadout. These unlockables could only previously be taken on a mission through an Agency Pickup.\nRed Rick\u2019s Broadsword\nWe\u2019ve moved the Broadsword and Mace into the \u2018Weapons\u2019 category in the Inventory. Previously, they were tagged as \u2018Gear\u2019.\nContract Apprentice\nWe\u2019ve added a new menu image for the Measuring Tape.\nConcept 5\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve made a change to the damage drop-off for the Concept 5 Pistol (Miami Mastery Unlock), which was too low after a range of about 50 metres. The damage for this gun has now been increased when fired at range.\nLandslide CCTV\nWe\u2019ve given additional clearances to the guard in the security room in the Landslide Bonus Mission so that he\u2019ll now react when 47 is caught trespassing by a security camera.\nRe-animated Score\nWe\u2019ve adjusted the mission end rating screen to only show the \u2018score animation\u2019 once. Previously, the animation would play and would then play again after returning from the Detailed Score page. Now, it\u2019ll only play the first time.\nColombian Clothing\nWe\u2019ve given one NPC near the default Starting Location in Santa Fortuna a new set of clothes. This is because he\u2019s got a twin nearby and their choice of clothing made it difficult to tell them apart in Contracts Mode.\nEnforce Yourself\nWe\u2019ve added Gunther Mueller and Spencer Green as enforcers for themselves in Whittleton Creek.\u00a0\nPriceless\nWe\u2019ve added a new version of the \u2018Priceless Challenge\u2019 to Whittleton Creek. This time, you\u2019ll need to Deliver the package for Mr. Batty and then find a way to make him go batty.\n\n\n\nGame Update 2.14: What\u2019s Changing?\n\n\n\nStatic Guards\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause guards to get stuck in an alerted state. If 47 triggers the alerted state and then changes disguise without the guards noticing, the guards could then get stuck.\nClothing Options\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could make it impossible for 47 to take a disguise from a container that had two bodies placed inside.\nDiscover Challenges\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could prevent the \u2018Discover [Location]\u2019 challenges from unlocking.\nFrisk Detection\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where concealable items (such as the Custom 5mm pistol or Concealable baton) would be labelled as \u2018detected during frisk \u2018 when inside a briefcase.\nRemember Jeff\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where NPC\u2019s that kill themselves, or are killed by another NPC, would prevent the Silent Assassin rating from being awarded.\u00a0\nClose Doors\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where 47 would sometimes not be able to close doors from the side/behind. This was previously possible prior to the 2.12 update and has now been rightly re-introduced.\nGuns Out\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could reliably cause a crash if 47 retrieves a large weapon from a briefcase while already holding another identical weapon.\nRemote Concussion\nWe\u2019ve fixed a visual issue with the images used for Remote Concussion Device and the Remote Explosive Device; we\u2019ve fixed the Notebook image and added a custom HUD image.\nTaser Triggers\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where tasers would not be insta-destroyed when used to trigger an accident with a gas leak or flammable liquid. They have always been insta-destroyed when used to trigger an accident with water, and will continue to do so.\nMaelstrom Mission\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the \u2018Contract\u2019 Mission Stories in Mumbai to be failed if 47 discovers the identity of the Maelstrom before starting them.\u00a0\nSay Cheese\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Catalina would walk between the balcony and Rico\u2019s Office endlessly if 47 doesn\u2019t follow her path and runs instead straight to Rico\u2019s Office.\nStatistical Progress\nWe\u2019ve fixed the Mastery Progress bars in the Statistics Menu for Hawke\u2019s Bay and Whittleton Creek. They\u2019ll now correctly display 5 and 15 levels respectively.\nSgail Dragger\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where dragging a body in a specific spot in Isle of Sgail could cause 47 to begin floating.\n[Editors Note (Nov 26, 2019): We\u2019ve added a visualisation of this fix below. Thanks, Cartoonishly!] \n\nI illustrated some patch notes from @IOInteractive about @Hitman to celebrate the 1 year anniversary.\u270f\ufe0f\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4e#hitman2 #fanart #gaming #patchnotes #updates #illegalfruit pic.twitter.com/nKAw6GCFMs\n\u2014 fox (@cartoonishly) November 24, 2019\n\nArk Storage\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could make it impossible to pick up the items inside the Ark crates on Isle of Sgail after performing a save/load cycle.\nLocation Overlap\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the area names on the Map for Isle of Sgail would overlap and be difficult to read.\nCover Trap\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue on Isle of Sgail where 47 could enter cover in a specific area and seemingly be invisible to guards. Now, they\u2019ll still have a target.\nRun-Coin\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where 47\u2019s running animation would be different (in a bad way) when holding certain coins.\nCome on, Stu!\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where sabotaged phone booth kills would correctly be counted as accidents, but the bodies being found would still incorrectly impact the end contract score. Fixed.\nLVA\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Mumbai where some Limited Vision Areas (bushes) didn\u2019t conceal 47, even though it looked as though they should. We\u2019ve adjusted the size of some of them and added their ability to conceal.\nAcquarium Error\nWe\u2019ve fixed an error on the Miami in-game Map where \u2018Acquarium\u2019 was mispelt.\nToilet (T)error\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that would cause the game to crash after shooting a toilet control panel twice.\nBolder Hues\nWe\u2019ve made a visual fix for some of the unlockable suits in the menu so that they match the actual colour of the suits in-game. We\u2019ve only updated the menu images and not made any changes to the suits in-game.\nRake Throw\nWe\u2019ve removed the \u201cnon-lethal throw\u201d tag from the Rake, because it cannot be thrown.\nRetour A La Terre\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue with the French localisation for a challenge in Santa Fortuna that could cause some confusion about how to complete it.\nFlamingo Framerates\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the framerate to drop for Xbox One X users that have enabled the \u2018High Quality\u2019 rendering quality.\nLegacy: Fugu Cleaver\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Hokkaido where the game would crash if you used a cleaver (or had one in your inventory) to cut the fugu fish.\nLegacy: Whose Gun Is It Anyway\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Paris where the guards in the basement security room might treat their own weapons as suspicious and move them from the table to the weapons locker.\nLegacy: Elite Trespass\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the Elite Soldier disguise in Marrakesh would incorrectly be considered \u2018Trespassing\u2019 on the school grounds, if it was acquired in a particular way.\nLegacy: Morgue Master\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where\u00a047 can get spotted when using the Morgue starting location in Hokkaido on Master Difficulty.\nLegacy: Redundant Frisk\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where 47 would get frisked outside of Strandberg\u2019s Office in the Swedish Embassy in Marrakesh, even when wearing the Embassy Security disguise. Now, he\u2019ll just be allowed straight into the office.\n\nGhost Mode Improvements\nGhost Game Rules\nWe\u2019ve added a Game Rules tile to the lobby to make it easier to learn what Ghost Mode is all about.\nEnd Game Statistics\nWe\u2019ve added game stats to the end game score screen. As well as the final score, you\u2019ll now also get an overview of various statistics such as deaths, NPC kills, disguises used, etc.\nGhost Tips\nWe\u2019ve added two new loading tips for Ghost Mode about item drops and noticed kills.\n\nPC-Specific Improvements\nDestination Scrolling\nWe\u2019ve added scroll-wheel functionality to the Destination and Campaign pages that allows players to scroll through those menus when the mouse cursor is placed in the lower half of the screen. Scrolling will change the displayed location, but will only change the selection if the cursor is placed on the location name.\u00a0\n\nKnown Issues\n\nWe\u2019ve listed some of the game\u2019s known issues below, so that you know we\u2019re aware. We\u2019ve always got eyes on the Technical Support and Bug Report threads on the Forums and Reddit too, so if you\u2019ve reported something there, we almost definitely know about it.\n\nWe are aware that players on PC are experiencing issues with \u201c0x8000000_\u201d (and related) crashes. We\u2019re working on a solution to this with our friends and partners at Nvidia.\nWe are aware of reports from our community that when 47 wears disguises with sunglasses, the glasses don\u2019t reflect in mirrors. This is done intentionally for performance reasons and won\u2019t be changed.\nWe have received reports that the Manhole Challenge in Whittleton Creek doesn\u2019t unlock when completed in Contracts Mode. This is because it was never intended to be available in Contracts Mode and was mislabeled. As of 2.14, we\u2019ve moved the challenge to only be visible under the \u2018Another Life\u2019 Story Mission to clear up this confusion.\nWhen getting frisked with the briefcase, it can sometimes result in an animation where the briefcase clips through 47\u2019s legs. It\u2019s just a visual issue and will be fixed.\nThe Shashka A33 rifle has barely audible sound effects when fired by NPC\u2019s. This will be fixed in a future update.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-february-update/"},

For HITMAN 2, we will pick our Featured Contracts based on themes.\u00a0Since February holds the ever-so-cherished Valentines Day, we are setting up a Hitman-inspired theme of love, labelled\u00a0\u201cBROKEN HEARTS\u201c.\nHowever the theme is\u00a0interpreted, is up to the creator.\nIf you want to submit your take on this month\u2019s theme\u00a0\u2013 click here \u2013\u00a0to see how you can submit your contract.\nMarch 1 \u2013 The Politician Elusive Target\nA new Elusive Target will arrive for the first time in Hawke\u2019s Bay for 10 days.

We\u2019ve also factored community feedback into the decision and wanted to tell you ahead of time. \nWe won\u2019t be removing and XP or progression if you\u2019ve already completed these challenges but they will be removed from the game with Update 2.14, so you\u2019ll have no in-game proof of your exploits.

She will be on the Isle of Sg\u00e0il for 10 days starting at 2 pm CET on Friday the 25th\u00a0of January.\n\nElusive Targets are the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created; a unique target that you\u2019ll only have one chance to eliminate. If you kill them or fail the contract, there will be no second chances.\u00a0When you\u2019re actually playing the contract, the Elusive Target will not appear on the map and will not appear in Instinct. In order to find them, you\u2019ll need to use clues from the briefing video and a photograph that you will be able to review. You\u2019ll need to explore, find your target, learn their patterns and come up with a plan to eliminate them \u2013 all whilst playing.\nElusive Target: The Appraiser\nLocation: Isle of Sg\u00e0il.\nTarget: Miranda Jamison\nMission: Eliminate Miranda Jamison and retrieve the notebook.\nStarts January 25th and will run for 10 days.\n\n\u00a0\nSummary:\nThe target is Miranda Jamison, director of the Gorka Institute in Barcelona, which is\u00a0the\u00a0premiere art authentication facility in the world. Jamison handles the pricing of many of the art industry\u2019s most prestigious pieces of art and she is one of the key drivers of the extensive art price fixing that takes place in the world.\nMrs Jamison is integral to the whole industry of driving up art prices, selecting just a handful of new talent each year to be the recipients of her blessings. This approach to fine art has driven countless normal galleries out of business over the years and resulted in the suicide of several distraught artists ruined by her fickle whims.\nIntel:\nBorn in England, Miranda Jamison (n\u00e9e Parker) developed an appreciation for fine arts at an early age and, thanks to her obvious talents and hard work, managed to attend Cambridge University from whence she accumulated multiple degrees in business and fine arts history.\nFrom there, Jamison went to work in various high-profile museums and was trained as a junior appraiser at a large American auction house. It was here she met the highly renowned art critic Alistair Jamison, who took her under his wing and trained her as a professional. The pair eventually became romantically involved and, despite a substantial age difference, married when Miranda was 28 and Alistair was 62. Miranda eventually became her husband\u2019s superior and gained a legendary sense for the value of historic objects, earning her the respect of many within the field.\nAt the age of 36, Miranda was widowed and at the funeral of her husband, she was approached by a group of men who explained to her that her husband had been involved in a complicated price fixing scheme. The group offered her his former role and access to the most prestigious art in the most. After some deliberation, she agreed. From then on, things escalated quickly.\nJamison modernized the price fixing methodology of both galleries and auction houses, introduced multiple new practices to keep gallery prices secret and callously dumped a large group of artists who saw their works turn worthless overnight. The consequences of this famous \u201ccrimson period\u201d were vast for artists and minor collectors, who lost both their fortunes and, in some cases, committed suicide.\nInitially hit by critique from some of the bigger collectors, the rise in value of the remaining works convinced them that the approach worked from a business point of view. Within five years, Miranda Jamison became not only a member of the art appreciation elite of the world but also a member of the secretive Ark Society. She now runs the largest art price fixing scheme in the world and is involved in everything from money laundering to tax evasion as a consequence.\nNow, Jamison is looking to expand her reach into the highest of tiers. To achieve that, she has stolen a painting from Randall Pryce, a former client of hers who had offered to sell it to her for $100 million \u2013 a price so ridiculous not even Jamison wanted to pay it. Jamison plans to \u201cgift\u201d the painting to The Ark Society in the name of famed adventurer Blake Nathaniel in the hopes that he will introduce her to his ultra-wealthy contacts.\n\u00a0\n\nMiranda Jamison\n\n\u00a0\n\nElusive Target Rewards:\nRemember we have rewards for completing Elusive Targets. Some will be familiar, others are entirely new.\nA mixture of HITMAN 2 location suits, iconic suits from previous Hitman titles and new suits specific to Elusive Target rewards can be unlocked, depending on how you complete the contracts. Any suit that is unlocked can be used in the planning phase for any mission, giving you more options to use different suits throughout HITMAN 2.\n\nGood luck.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman2-et-appraiser/"},

If you\u2019ve already completed the challenge associated this reward, the item will be added to your inventory shortly after the release of the game update.\nQuestion Mark\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause some NPCs to investigate distractions from unreasonable distances. We\u2019ve asked them to hold back and be less curious. The NPC\u2019s that you expect to investigate will now do so.\nBlurred Scope\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause 47\u2019s rifle scope to be blurry when zoomed in.\nSuit Shadow\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that was preventing 47\u2019s shadow from rendering whilst wearing the Raven Suit.\nClosing Doors\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the wine cabinet doors to always be open. They\u2019re now closed for safety reasons.\nCrash Control\nWe\u2019ve fixed a handful of issues that could cause the game to crash, including from standby/rest mode(s).\nExploding Molehills\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause explosives concealed in molehills to not harm NPCs on Whittleton Creek.\nIn Place\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Challenges regarding Featured Contracts have placeholder names in non-English languages.\nMore in Sync\nWe\u2019ve fixed some inconsistencies between subtitles and dialogue in Miami.\nCar Trouble\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Miami that could cause Sierra\u2019s car to not crash despite an explosive device detonating on her car.\nWhere\u2019s Nolan?\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where our \u2018Mini Map Rotation\u2019 options were inverted. We know that nobody likes to play inverted, so we\u2019ve made sure that \u2018on\u2019 means on and \u2018off\u2019 means off.\nMuffin Merchant\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the muffin servers in Whittleton Creek to continually talk about needing more stock and their intentions to inform \u2018Helen\u2019 about the stock levels, but not actually doing it. Now they will.\nAn Apple a Day\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Whittleton Creek that could cause the\u00a0An Apple a Day Mission Story to get stuck if 47 knocks out Janus while performing the Health Check.\nInventory Extension\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the Inventory menu to seemingly not display all unlocked items. This was a UX issue that was causing the items to be displayed on a \u2018hidden\u2019 window on the right-hand side of the screen.\nMission Story Consistency\nWe\u2019ve fixed a handful of issues with Mission Story guidance prompts on Miami and Whittleton Creek.\nHector and Sheikh\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Hector and Sheikh Salman al-Ghazali were in a dialogue loop where they constantly repeated the same conversation in Miami.\nSprechen sie Deutsch?\nF\u00fcr unsere Deutschen Spieler: wir haben einen kleinen Fehler beseitigt, bei dem der Schl\u00fcssel zum Pool f\u00e4lschlicherweise als \u201cAutoschl\u00fcssel\u201d \u00fcbersetzt wurde. Tut uns leid!\nTP\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause 47 to teleport when taking out a shotgun and aiming in a crowd. Now, he\u2019ll have to walk.\nRequiem\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where 47 could enter an open coffin or morgue table during combat, provided that he isn\u2019t actively visible to any NPC\u2019s.\nFlying Flare\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause a flare to float above the ground during the helicopter exit cutscene in Isle of Sgail.\n\u2013 Silent Assassin Status \u2013\nIn our previous Release Notes (2.12), we updated you on the Silent Assassin rating and how some unintended changes were made. Whilst we continue to work on a long-term fix, we\u2019ve now updated the text for the scoring requirements and some challenges from \u201cNever Spotted\u201d to \u201cNever Compromised\u201d. These are not the final changes for this rating, but our intention here is to make the in-game communication better in the short term. We\u2019re still working on the final solution and will share further updates as soon as we have them.\n\nGhost Mode Improvements\nGhost Crash\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the game crashes when exiting to the main menu from a quick match Ghost Mode session.\nOpen Sesame\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause Ghost Crates containing disguises to remain closed until all disguises had been taken. Now, when either player takes a disguise, the crate will open and the other disguise will no longer be available. The opposing player will still have 10 seconds to pick up any of the items.\n\nPC Specific Improvements\nWindow Scaling\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the game crashes when switching from Fullscreen to Windowed mode.\u00a0\nDiscovery Drop\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause drops in framerate when discovering a new area.\nRazer Chroma\nWe\u2019ve extended our Razer Chroma Support. See details here.\nBig Picture Buttons\nWe\u2019ve added some big buttons to the Game\u2019s Launcher when starting the game through Big Picture Mode on Steam, to indicate that you can \u2018play\u2019 and \u2018quit\u2019 using the controller.\nLauncher Benchmark\nWe\u2019ve added a Benchmark option to the PC launcher.\n\nKnown Issues (Reported By Community)\nAs part of these release notes, we wanted to give you an idea of just a few points that we see lots of discussion about, just so that you know that we know. Looking ahead, we\u2019re already hard at work on our next update, 2.14, which we aim to release in February.\n\nIssues where weapons can become invisible.\nAn issue with animations and coins.\n47 can get spotted when using the Morgue starting location in Hokkaido on Master Difficulty.\nThe Meaty Bone and Sacrifical Knife items cannot be used as starting equipment.\nThe Silverballer does not have the Steady Aim trait.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-game-update-2-13/"},

If you have a 4K TV and a XBOX ONE X or PS4 PRO we upscale the picture to 4K and then draw a crisp 4K GUI on top.\nIf you have a 1080p TV we will render in higher than 1080p resolution internally and then downscale to 1080p to increase quality and reduce jaggies. On XBOX ONE though we\u2019re rendering in 1080p/60 FPS.\n\nIncreased texture resolution:\n\nTextures are usually authored in higher resolutions and then downscaled to fit in memory.\nWith more memory available on the newer consoles this downscale is not necessary anymore and the textures can be enjoyed in their authored resolutions.\n\nUpgraded texture formats:\n\nThe new consoles have support for newer and improved texture formats.\nWe use these where applicable for better-looking textures with fewer artifacts.\n\nSuper-sampling &amp; upscale support settings:\n\nXbox One\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1920 x 1080\nPS4 Base\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2304 x 1296 (44% more than 1080p)\nPS4 Pro\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2560 x 1440 (+177%)\nXbox One X\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3200 x 1800 (+277%)\n\nHeightened shadow map and mirror resolutions:\n\nWe have increased the resolution of shadow maps to get better and crisper looking shadows.\nLikewise, for mirrors \u2013 reflections are sharper than ever.\n\nImproved lighting:\n\nLighting calculations have been re-engineered. Back when the original launched it was a popular optimization technique to bake some lighting calculations into textures to save work on the GPU.\nThese days it is more effective to just do the calculations and it also avoids the banding artifacts caused by using a texture. Together with higher resolution and higher precision internal render buffers it gives you a better quality image \u2013 especially noticeable with specular highlights which are much smoother now.\n\nControls: What has changed?\n\nTo ensure a more fluid experience, we have updated the controls to fit current gen consoles with smoother analog stick handling and better response.\nThe button mapping has been updated to match current gen controllers and maintain peak performance.\n\nContracts Mode: Where is it? Why is it gone?\nEver since the change to remove contracts mode from Absolution was forced upon us due to GDPR rules and the fact that we do not have ownership of the Absolution Contracts Mode servers, we\u2019ve been looking into ways to restore it. We will continue to investigate other possibilities, but we can\u2019t promise anything specific at this point in time.\nWhy no PC version?\nThe key focus with this collection was to bring these classic games into the modern age to be playable on current gen consoles\u00a0(PS4 / PS4 Pro and Xbox One / Xbox One X).\nSince PCs have been able to keep up with modern technical demands, we wanted to give our console players the opportunity to enjoy these games in high definition quality.\n\nSCREENSHOTS\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\t    \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-hd-faq/"},

He\u2019ll probably still get away with it.\nAutosave HUD\nThe small icon in the bottom right-hand side of the screen that indicates whether you can save or not, is now toggled \u2018off\u2019 by default.\nWhittleton Creek Loading UI\nWe\u2019ve made a change to the objectives icons visible during the loading screen for Whittleton Creek, in order to describe the objectives fully.\nBus Stopped\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could make it impossible to exit a created Contract in Mumbai if the main exit (bus) was used.\nToo Much Sugar\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where Agent 47 could insert an infinite number of coins into a vending machine by concealing a coin in the briefcase. We laughed at this one, but it\u2019s still been fixed.\nSensitive Security\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause some car alarms to trigger in Miami without any player interaction.\u00a0\nHidden Targets\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where unconscious targets could be placed into cupboards in some rare cases.\nPoor Jeeves\nThe Butler disguise was previously not required for the Chameleon challenge in Isle of Sgail. Now it is.\nPostal Insurance\nThe \u2018Priceless\u2019 challenge has been removed from the game on all platforms because the package was indestructible. Mr Batty will be pleased, for now\u2026\nTriumph Trigger\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could prevent the fireworks and confetti from triggering when Sierra walks on the podium.\nChallenge Breaks\nWe\u2019ve fixed a visual issue in the main menu that would cause the \u2018Challenges Completed\u2019 number to break into two lines when players reached double figures.\nOne A Day\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where an apple would be considered as an illegal item in Whittleton Creek on Casual Difficulty Level.\n[Editors Note (Nov 26, 2019): We\u2019ve added a visualisation of this fix below. Thanks, Cartoonishly!]\n\nI illustrated some patch notes from @IOInteractive about @Hitman to celebrate the 1 year anniversary.\u270f\ufe0f\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4e#hitman2 #fanart #gaming #patchnotes #updates #illegalfruit pic.twitter.com/nKAw6GCFMs\n\u2014 fox (@cartoonishly) November 24, 2019\n\nBriefcase\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not *that* fix. Instead, we\u2019ve fixed an issue that was preventing some players from accessing the Aluminium Travel Briefcase. Check your inventories\u2026\nTerminus\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that prevented eligible players from being awarded with the Terminus Suit for completing an Elusive Target with the Silent Assassin rating.\nElusive Target Text\nWe\u2019ve made some subtle changes to the communication when attempting to launch an Elusive Target that isn\u2019t live yet. The intention is to give more information to the player and have it feel less like an \u2018error\u2019 message.\n\nGhost Mode Improvements\nTimer Stacking\nWe\u2019ve added a new mechanic that adds 20 seconds to the opponent\u2019s target countdown clock for each consecutive noticed target kill/pacification you perform. For example, 1 noticed kill equals the regular 20 seconds. A consecutive noticed kill will result in an additional 20 seconds being offered to your opponent, up to a maximum of 80 seconds. We\u2019ve made this change to further encourage unnoticed kills/pacifications and to give more room for players to eliminate their target without being pressurised by opponents who consistently perform noticed kills. \nOnce both players have eliminated the target, the waiting period for the next target will be 10 seconds or less, depending what was on the clock when the second players\u2019 target was killed.\nGhost PiP\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause the PiP camera in Ghost Mode to be too dark if a kill is performed indoors.\nPiP Boy\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the audio cues for the PiP camera are played, even when players have disabled it.\nLobby Challenges\nWe\u2019ve added the Challenges Menu to the Ghost Mode Lobby.\nSFX Connection\nWe\u2019ve added a sound effect that plays when you have connected to another player in the lobby. It sounds a bit like \u201cwhooosh-ka-ching\u201d, but we recommend you play Ghost Mode to hear it for yourself.\nMission Timer\nWe\u2019ve disabled the \u2018Mission Timer\u2019 option when playing Ghost Mode.\nConsiderate Assassin\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Ghost Mode that could cause inconsistencies with explosive devices.\nCrate Crashers\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue in Ghost Mode that could reliably cause a crash when retrieving items from Ghost Crates.\nFish Lunch\nThe Ghost Mode announcer will now declare \u201cVictory\u201d or \u201cDefeat\u201d at the end of a completed match.\n\nLegacy Pack Specific Improvements\nJeg Sauna Hende Stadig Ikke\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where raising the temperature of the sauna in Hokkaido would insta-kill the NPC\u2019s in the sauna. Now, they\u2019ll leave the room, as expected.\nShadow Man\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue on Xbox One that could cause shadows in Marrakesh to behave erratically near the APC turret controls.\nFrequently Answered Questions Pt. 2\nWe still strongly recommend that any players who are having issues with the Legacy Pack check the Legacy Pack FAQ.\n\n\nPC Specific Improvements\nGo to Map\nPress the M key to go directly to map, do not pass Challenges, do not collect $200. You can also choose to bind it to another key in the Options menu.\nScreenspace Shadows\nWe\u2019ve added a new Graphics Option; Screenspace Shadows. Toggle on to give high quality shadow detail.\nReflection Quality\nWe\u2019ve added a new Graphics Option; Reflection Quality. Toggle off, low, default or high to control the resolution of the rendered reflections in mirrors and floors.\nMotion Blur\nWe\u2019ve added a new Graphics Option; Motion Blur. Toggle off, low, default or high to give a smoother look.\nDynamic Sharpening\nWe\u2019ve added a new Graphics Option; Dynamic Sharpening. This option counters effects caused by temporal anti-aliasing.\nSLI Performance\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause performance drops for players using NVIDIA cards with SLI enabled.\nSimulation Separation\nIn the release notes for our previous update, we included a new option called \u201cSimulation Quality.\u201d In this update, we\u2019ve split this option into two; Graphical Simulation and Audio Simulation, allowing players to take advantage of the audio improvements but without affecting their GFX performance.\nSteam Trading Cards\nWe\u2019ve added support for Steam Trading Cards, including badges, profile backgrounds and emoticons.\n\nSilent Assassin Status\nWe want to give you an update on the Silent Assassin status. We introduced a new feature with our 2.11 update in November that allowed players to retain their Silent Assassin rating, even if they were spotted by their target. We really like this feature and what it adds to the game. Unfortunately, this change brought with it some changes to gameplay that made it much easier to earn the SA rating. Essentially, you now need to enter a \u2018compromised\u2019 state in order to lose the SA rating, rather than just be \u2018spotted\u2019.\nWe\u2019re not happy with the way things are currently and we\u2019re going\u00a0to make further changes to keep the SA rating as something that is difficult to earn and feels like a rewarding challenge to complete. We\u2019re already deep into what those changes can be and we will have an update on this specific issue to share in the new year.\nOne final thing; we fully acknowledge that we\u2019ve been slow to respond on this particular matter. In future, we\u2019ll strive to do better. Thanks!\n\nWhat\u2019s Next? The January Update\nWe\u2019re already looking ahead to our January update, which will bring more fixes and more improvements as well as some other exciting announcements. We\u2019ll also have a full January Roadmap to release early next year, which is packed full of brand new content. We\u2019re looking forward to it.

Each week, you\u2019ll be able to play something fresh and new, including a holiday surprise! Here\u2019s a full look at everything that\u2019s coming your way in December!\nDecember 6 \u2013 Occupational Hazards\nTo kick things off, we\u2019ve cherry-picked 5 Featured Contracts to be added to the game. All Featured Contracts are created by members of the community and then added to the game for all players to enjoy. For HITMAN 2, we will pick our Featured Contracts based on themes \u2013 and the first is \u2018Occupational Hazards\u2019, as all contracts are focused on jobs, occupations and professions. Later this month, we\u2019ll share information on the theme for January and how you can submit your contracts to be included.\nDecember 13 \u2013 The Aelwin Augment\nEscalation Contracts focus on your skills as Agent 47 and how you can adapt your playstyles to the various complications that we can throw your way. Escalations are not necessarily about immersion, but definitely give you a gameplay challenge. Our second Escalation Contract (we\u2019ve already released one in Santa Fortuna!) takes you to Isle of Sgail and we think it\u2019ll be a memorable visit.\nDecember 18 \u2013 Surprise!\nA time-limited holiday surprise awaits you on December 18 for a limited time\u2026\nDecember 21 \u2013 The Revolutionary\nA new Elusive Target will arrive in Santa Fortuna for 10 days and you\u2019ll be able to unlock the Casual Tourist with gloves suit if you manage to complete it. Check our Elusive Target Rewards blog post for a full overview of the ET rewards. We\u2019ll tell you more about this contract at a later date.\nDecember 27 \u2013 The Turms Infatuation\nWe wrap up the month (pun intended) with an Escalation in Santa Fortuna. Enjoy!\n[Update: We\u2019ve corrected the date of \u2018The Turms Infatuation to December 27th (was 29th). We also want to confirm that there is a game update scheduled for release in December. We saw some questions about this and we\u2019ll considering adding this information to future Roadmaps.]\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-december-2018-roadmap/"},

We\u2019ve already announced that you\u2019ll be able to unlock the Explosive Pen just by playing the contract, but we also have more rewards for completing Elusive Targets. Some will be familiar, others are entirely new.\nA mixture of HITMAN 2 location suits, iconic suits from previous Hitman titles and new suits specific to Elusive Target rewards can be unlocked, depending on how you complete the contracts. Any suit that is unlocked can be used in the planning phase for any mission, giving you more options to use different suits throughout HITMAN 2.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-elusive-target-rewards/"},
{"title": "HITMAN 2 \u2013 Game Update 2.11", "date": "November 20, 2018", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe\u2019re preparing to launch the first game update for HITMAN 2 on November 20, 2018.\nUpdate 2.11 will arrive at 11am UTC and will be released during a 3-hour server maintenance window that is scheduled to begin at 10am UTC and end at 1pm UTC. The update will be released across all platforms and will weigh in at approximately 400mb on Xbox One and 1.2GB on PS4 and PC. Please note that the update version you see on your console or PC may differ from our internal names for the update.\nThe 2.11 update addresses multiple issues that have been reported by our community in the first week of release. We\u2019ve also included a ton of improvements that didn\u2019t quite make it into the game for launch.\nWhat\u2019s Changing?\nOverall Game Improvements\nWe\u2019ve made hundreds of improvements, fixes and tweaks to the entire game across all disciplines. These improvements will greatly improve the experience of playing HITMAN 2.\nThe Undying Elusive Target\nThe first Elusive Target for HITMAN 2 goes live at 5pm UTC on November 20 and will run for 14 days.\nElusive Target Rewards Challenges\nWe\u2019re adding the challenges that will unlock Elusive Target Rewards, including the Explosive Pen for The Undying mission as well as the suit unlocks. See our HITMAN 2 Elusive Target Rewards Blog Post for full details on what can be unlocked and how.\nSilent Target Assassin\nThe knowledge of a target will no longer count against the Silent Assassin rating. To clarify, if a target spots you before you kill them, the SA rating is still awarded. However, if the target\u2019s knowledge is shared to any other NPC, the SA rating is not awarded.\nMission Story Consistency\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve fixed multiple issues across different Mission Stories in the game, where characters might suspend their routine, required items are unusable, etc.\nFloating Targets\nAlma and Sean 2 will no longer float in their bed in Hawke\u2019s Bay.\nPress X to\u2026\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where multiple, overlapping prompts could appear on an NPC depending on what 47 was carrying.\nDifficulty HUD Default\nThe \u2018Difficulty HUD\u2019 option will now be defaulted to OFF. It can be toggled to ON in the Gameplay Options.\nClip Out\nWe\u2019ve fixed multiple issues across the game where 47 could get stuck in cover, clip into cover, NPC\u2019s get stuck in doors and other related issues.\nWater Improvements\nWe\u2019ve improved the fidelity of some of the water in Santa Fortuna, so it now moves more realistically and includes foam. We\u2019ve also tweaked the water you can see on the horizon in some levels to look more realistic.\nObjective Icons\nWe\u2019ve tweaked the icons for objectives so that they accurately show what you\u2019re supposed to do. For example, the \u2018Locate Exit\u2019 objective will no longer be displayed with a \u2018target kill\u2019 icon.\nCrash Fixes\nWe\u2019ve fixed various issues that were causing crashes on all three platforms.\nEscalation Situation\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could prevent the \u2018Silent Escalation\u2019 Challenge from completing, despite players completing the requirements.\nBriefcase Blending\nWe\u2019ve fixed a visual issue that would occur when Agent 47 would start a mission in a blend-in pose and hold the briefcase. He\u2019s probably just happy that it\u2019s back again and doesn\u2019t want to let it go. Either way, the briefcase will now start next to 47, rather than in his hands.\nOut of This World\nWe\u2019ve fixed various issues where players could get \u2018out of world\u2019 or (leave the playable space) or see out of world by moving the camera in certain ways in certain players.\nCamera Crasher\nWe\u2019ve made a change to the destruction of security cameras, where they can no longer be destroyed by a thrown heavy item.\nConsiderate Assassin\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the ICA Tripwire Mine would behave erratically if placed in an Agency Pickup. Essentially, the mine would be activated before 47 could pick it up and it would kill him if he tried.\nLong Way to Go\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue where the target in Hawke\u2019s Bay would not report a found weapon to the closest guard. Now she does.\nTrophies / Achievements Polish\nWe\u2019ve taken the Opportunity to ensure Mission Stories are accurately described in our trophies / achievements. We\u2019ve updated some of the artwork too.\nGhost Mode Communication\nWe\u2019ve made various improvements to the communication around Ghost Mode, including an addition that occurs if you get disconnected from your opponent during a match where we now let you know that was why the matched ended. We\u2019ve also made sure that all suits will display on the end-match screen.\nBoot Flow\nAlthough we recommend that you watch them, we\u2019ve made it possible to get into the game faster by skipping the videos in the boot flow. We have also made minor adjustments to the Privacy Policy that is shown when launching the game, to clarify which sections are relevant for playing the game. The full policy can still be viewed on our website.\nThe Source Search\nWe\u2019ve added The Source mission to the Contracts Search options. It should have always been there.\nUI_Contract_Desc\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause a mission description to appear in coded text.\nNAT Today\nThe Lobby screens for Ghost Mode and Sniper Assassin will now display NAT Type information for players with a Type 2 or 3 connection.\nFind 47\nThe in-game Notebook Map now auto-centres on 47 everytime it is opened. Previously, it could retain the previous position and make it difficult to find your location.\nInfinite Training\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause infinite loading in the ICA Facility if a player skips an exit cinematic at a specific time.\nCompletionist\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could prevent the \u2018Smells Like Nail Polish\u2019 challenge from unlocking in Hawke\u2019s Bay, and therefore preventing the Completionist trophy/achievement from unlocking.\nLOC down\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue with the challenge descriptions not matching their image for users playing in Italian, German, Brasilian and Japanese.\nArrivederci Regionale Prima\nReadership was down for the Regionale Prima in Mumbai. As of today, the \u201c\u0906\u091c \u0915\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u201d newspaper will be in circulation instead. The Regionale Prima will still be published in Sapienza.\n\u00a0\nLegacy Pack Specific Issues\nHeadmaster\u2019s Revenge\u00a0\nTo resolve a few issues, we\u2019ve simplified the Headmaster\u2019s Revenge challenge to simply require players to eliminate the Reza Zeydan whilst disguised as the Headmaster.\nRooftop Guard\nThat guard in Colorado who could end up on the rooftop of the mansion has been asked to come down. He complied.\nTrespassing Makeover\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause 47 to be trespassing while following the doctor during the \u2018Makeover\u2019 Mission Story.\nFrequently Answered Questions\nWe strongly recommend that any players who are having issues with the Legacy Pack check the Legacy Pack FAQ.\n\n\u00a0\nPC Specific Issues\nBullet Decals\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause graphical corruption when shooting in the same place multiples times, especially on wooden surfaces.\nPC optimizations\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause frame rate drops and sound distortion on machines with a low number of CPU cores.\nSimulation Quality\nWe\u2019ve added an option under Graphics called \u2018Simulation Quality\u2019, which will improve the amount and fidelity of crowds, cloth, destruction and particles system, depending on your CPU. The visual content only applies to the main campaign missions in Miami and Mumbai. The Simulation Quality option also affects audio across all game content.\nThis setting has three options; Base (CPUs with 4 cores or fewer), Better (CPUs with 6 cores) and Best (CPUs with 8 cores or more).\nHotfix Reminder\nWe released a hotfix for PC last week that fixed the below two issues:\nHDR Fix\nWe\u2019ve made a change to our HDR setup on PC. It is now possible to play HITMAN 2 in HDR in Exclusive Fullscreen. For this to work, it is necessary to\u00a0disable\u00a0the \u2018HDR and WCG\u2019 option in Windows 10 under the \u2018Display\u2019 menu. We\u2019re continuing to work on and improve this feature in future updates.\nPhenom CPU Fix\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause players with an AMD Phenom CPU to crash to desktop when launching a HITMAN 2 mission. This issue should no longer occur.\n\u00a0\nKnown Issues (Reported by the Community)\nWe are reading and tracking all feedback related to HITMAN 2. As part of these release notes, we wanted to give you an idea of just a few points that we see lots of discussion about, just so that you know that we know. You know? Looking ahead, we\u2019re already hard at work on our next update, 2.12, which we aim to release in December.\n\nLocation Mastery trophies/achievements do not unlock after earning Mastery outside of that locations main campaign mission.\nThe Kalmer-1 Tranquilizer gun loses ammo when reloading a save game.\nThe \u2018Autosave allowed\u2019 icon cannot be toggled off.\nThe new \u2018homing\u2019 ability of 47\u2019s briefcase is not strong enough and does not target multiple NPCs.\nCertain NPCs can stagger when shot and get caught in specific walls.\n47\u2019s shadow is missing on certain suits.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-game-update-2-11/"},

HITMAN 2 will be in your hands in a matter of days and we are stoked to see how you react, what you play first and how awesome you think it all is!\nTo prepare you all as much as possible, here\u2019s a Q&amp;A that will prepare you for launch.\nLaunch Timings aka \u201cWhen can I play HITMAN 2?\u201d\nOn PS4 and Xbox One, HITMAN 2 will have a \u2018rolling midnight\u2019 launch. That means the game will be available to play whenever it is midnight in your country. For anyone who has purchased the Gold Edition or Collector\u2019s Edition, that will be on November 9th. For all other players, that will be on November 13th. If you have pre-ordered a physical copy of HITMAN 2, the delivery times will naturally vary according to your retailer and we, unfortunately, don\u2019t have any control over that.\nOn PC, HITMAN 2 will launch for all Gold Edition owners simultaneously at 10 am PT / 7 pm CET on November 9th. For all other players, HITMAN 2 will be available at the same time on November 13.\nPre-load aka \u201cCan I download HITMAN 2 before the release date?\u201d\nThere are different pre-load options in place, depending on your platform.\nPS4 (Digital): Players can pre-load HITMAN 2 beginning 48 hours prior to the release date. That 48-hour period will adjust based on whether you pre-ordered the Gold, Collector\u2019s or Standard version of the game.\nXbox One (Digital): Pre-loading has already begun, allowing players to pre-load the entire game ahead of release. Make sure to keep an eye on any pending updates for HITMAN 2.\nSteam: All pre-orders will automatically begin downloading at 10 am PT / 7 pm CET on the release date. (We are currently investigating our options for enabling a pre-load on steam. We can\u2019t make any promises at this stage, but we will update this post when we have more information to share.)\nGame Size aka \u201cHow much storage space do I need?\u201d\nHITMAN 2 will require at least 60GB of storage space on all platforms. In addition, the Legacy Pack DLC will require an additional 45GB of storage space.\nDay 1 Patch aka \u201cWhat do I need to download on release day?\u201d\nWith the introduction of the World of Assassination, we set out to create a digital home for everything Hitman related, all living under one ever-expanding roof. In order to accomplish this goal, while also providing the strongest possible HITMAN 2 experience, our initial game update will require players to download the final two campaign locations. We estimate the download to be approximately 12-15GB for physical disc owners. This update will be \u2018built-in\u2019 for digital owners, who shouldn\u2019t expect a game update on day one.\nAll of the game updates that we will release for HITMAN 2 are intended to enhance the overall game experience for players, whether that\u2019s to add support for Ghost Mode through new locations; free live content via Elusive Targets, Escalations, Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode (incl. Elusive Target No. 1 Starring Sean Bean); or other quality of life improvements.\nLegacy Rewards aka \u201cThank you for playing our game\u201d\nWe\u2019re incredibly humbled to see the huge amount of players in HITMAN. To date, there have been more than 17 million registered players for the game and we hope to see just as many playing HITMAN 2! As a small way to say a big \u201cthank you\u201d, we\u2019ve created some unlocks that will be given to HITMAN 2 players that have previously played HITMAN. The below image explains it all completely.\n\nSniper Assassin aka \u201cIs this part of the full game now?\u201d\nWe released Sniper Assassin as an early access pre-order bonus. With the release of HITMAN 2, the Sniper Assassin \u2018Himmelstein\u2019 map will be available to all players as a brand new game mode within HITMAN 2. However, we\u2019ve made some improvements and tweaks as part of our commitment to supporting our new game modes. To start, we\u2019ve added a matchmaking option (that will launch in a beta state), incorporated the new Performance XP that allows you to rank up your player profile and added achievements/trophies for this game mode. As a result of that work, progression from the standalone Sniper Assassin will not be carried over into HITMAN 2. Additionally, the standalone version will be shut down on 13 November 2018 and players will need to launch HITMAN 2 to play Sniper Assassin.\nUnlocks Transfer aka \u201cWhat about my suits?\u201d\nItems and progression will not be directly carried over from HITMAN into HITMAN 2. However, the majority of items can be unlocked through the HITMAN Legacy Pack. With regards to suits specifically, anyone who redeems or purchases the GOTY Legacy Pack will have instant access to the 3 GOTY suits in HITMAN 2.

We also gave you the opportunity to vote to unlock one of these items in HITMAN 2.\nYour choice was between the Flash Grenade Robot, Earphones Garotte and Explosive Pen.

We know that many of you might want to use your new tool to eliminate Mark Faba, so we\u2019ve made sure to add the Explosive Pen into the mission itself as well. If you look closely enough, you\u2019ll be able to find all three items, so that you have at least one chance to use whatever item it is that you voted for.

It can be locked on to a target and thrown for a lethal kill and will explode shortly after with a powerful blast. It can also be throw to the ground before exploding. If you want, you can also conceal it inside a briefcase.\nThe Undying Elusive Target contract will start in HITMAN 2 on November 20 and will run for 14 days \u2013 an extension of 4 days and a change to what we originally announced. We made this change to ensure that we give players two weekends to take on the mission.

It\u2019s a 1v1 online mode that will put all of your assassination skills to the test as you compete against your opponent to eliminate targets quickly and cleanly to take the win. We\u2019re incredibly excited to share the first details with you in the Ghost Mode Gameplay Trailer:\n\nGhost Mode challenges you to earn 5 points before your opponent by eliminating targets. To earn a point, the kill must be unnoticed and the body cannot be found for a short time afterwards. You\u2019ll also lose a point for eliminating non-targets, so be smart and precise. Once one target has been eliminated, both players will begun the hunt again with a new target. To help you in your mission, you can pick up items, disguises and weapons from Ghost Crates. The items in each one are randomised but they are the same for you and your opponent. You can only take one item from each Ghost Crate and doing so removes that item as a choice for your opponent.\n\nThe unique twist with Ghost Mode is that each player is in their own \u2018reality\u2019, where your actions only affect your reality \u2013 but you\u2019ll always be able to see a \u2018Ghost\u2019 version of your opponent. You\u2019ll see exactly what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019re wearing and any items they\u2019re holding. One key strategic element in Ghost Mode is the use of Ghost Items, as these are the only way to impact your opponents reality. For example, throwing a Ghost Coin will attract attention in your reality, but will also do so in your opponents reality.\nYou\u2019ll get Picture-in-pictures updates along the way and an announcer will keep you informed about key elements in the match. In the screenshot below, you can see that Player 2 has eliminated their target and Player 1 now has 20 seconds to equalize the score and earn a point. After those 20 seconds, a new target will be selected. Player 1 would be advised not to panic, because if a player is killed at anytime, they will be spawned back into the location but will retain their disguise and combat status. No points are lost upon death.\n\nGhost Mode is a brand new game mode that we\u2019re excited to hear your feedback on. When we launch HITMAN 2 next month(!), Ghost Mode will be available on Miami and we\u2019ll be adding more locations shortly after launch, including World of Assassination locations through the Legacy Pack. We\u2019ll also be working to improve Ghost Mode post-launch with updates and tweaks.\nThat\u2019s our part of kick-starting this discussion and we hand it over to you to tell us what you think. Find us on Twitter or we\u2019ll be reading in the Forum and on Reddit.\n/Travis\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-ghost-mode/"},

In fact, a lot of it has already been released.\nAlongside all of that coverage, we wanted to give you some info on two of the areas that you\u2019ll see for the first time now that the embargoes have lifted; progression and difficulty.\nWe\u2019ve already seen lots of discussions about these two areas and so to give you the best insights, we\u2019ve invited HITMAN 2\u2019s Lead Game Designer, Andreas Krogh, to talk about our aims and ambitions for these two areas and what you can expect from them when the game launches.\nHITMAN 2 Progression\nAndreas: The HITMAN 2 progression system is centred around mastering locations. As you level up the Mastery track for each location, you unlock starting locations, agency pickups and new items that give you new options to take on each mission in new ways. Progress can be achieved by either completing Challenges or earning Performance XP.\nPerformance XP is a new system and acts as a second avenue to accumulate experience points. The Performance system awards a small amount of XP for doing moment-to-moment actions during a playthrough, like taking someone out silently, hiding a body or killing a target.\u00a0By default, Performance XP will be displayed as you perform the action in-game, but this can be toggled on or off in Settings.\nTo visualize your overall progress and time investment into HITMAN 2, we created a Player Profile that levels up according to your total XP earned. There\u2019s also a player badge that is the visual representation of your profile level. Both Mastery and Performance XP are funneled into the Player Profile as well as the Mastery Track, leveling\u00a0both up as you progress through the game.\u00a0Outside of those two systems, we\u2019ve also added more items that can be unlocked by completing specific Challenges.\nBoth XP systems will also work on the Season One locations within HITMAN 2 if you own the Legacy Pack. Because of that, we\u2019ve tweaked the mastery tracks for the Legacy locations so that they give a more directed progression of unlocks and the ambition is to give you something valuable whenever you invest time into the game.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHITMAN 2 Difficulty Levels\nAndreas:\u00a0Hitman has historically always been a hard game to pick up and we are taking steps to make the game more approachable while still keeping the core that current players like.\u00a0We want our difficulty levels to offer something to both new players, experimenting players and veterans, etc.\nFor HITMAN 2, we will have three difficulty levels;\u00a0Casual, Professional and Master to try and do just that.\n\nCasual is made to give new players an easier way into the game. It will also give all players an easier way to mess around with the world and see what happens without fear of failing.\nProfessional is the default entry point and balanced to give players a feeling of being a true assassin, using all of the game\u2019s intricate mechanics together with their ingenuity to assassinate their targets.\nMaster is for the player that needs an extra challenge. Combat will be extremely hard and the NPCs will be more aware of their surroundings, making stealth gameplay a greater challenge too.\n\nAs with the progression system, all of our difficulty levels can be selected on the Legacy locations within HITMAN, 2 if you have them. There\u2019s also some unlocks that can only be earned by completing\u00a0challenges on specific difficulties to give you ways to show you\u2019re a true Master!\n\n\u00a0\nThere you have it. Three difficulty levels, a new Player Profile and a new progression system for HITMAN 2 at launch. Exciting stuff! You may notice from the screenshot above that we have re-named \u2018Opportunities\u2019 to \u2018Mission Stories\u2019. They\u2019ve also been added to the above menu so that you can choose one to track before you launch the mission.\nLook out for more details about HITMAN 2 coming this week and next! It\u2019s all getting very real and we cannot wait to see the reactions!\n/Travis\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-2-progression-and-difficulty/"},

Take a look at the full monthly roadmap to get an overview of everything that\u2019s coming your way.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve enlisted a HITMAN player to be our Contract Curator and this month\u00a0BernardoOne has stepped up to the plate to put forward his best selection of contracts for all players to enjoy. He\u2019s a longtime Hitman fan from the beautiful land of Portugal, and who knows a thing or two about turning rat poison into missiles.\nHis chosen contracts will be available to play on the 17th of August 2018 \u2013 So let\u2019s hear more about them!\n\nHello BernardoOne! Can you tell us a bit about who you are?\n\nHello there! I\u2019m Bernardo, from Portugal. I\u2019m a big HITMAN fan, currently working as well as trying to get my degree, and playing a ton of HITMAN in my free time!\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\n\nPeople can find me on twitch\u00a0and youtube. I do speedruns, as well as making the occasional crazy new invention hehe.\nThis year, IOI is celebrating 20 years of making games and we\u2019d like to know about the first IOI game that you played. Can you tell us about that?\n\nMy first contact with the series was watching my cousin play Hitman 2: Silent Assassin (2002). It looked pretty intriguing at the time, but I never got into it. Years later I was introduced to Blood Money by a friend of mine. She\u2019s a huge fan of the Hitman franchise and lent me her PS2 copy of it. I then fell in love with the game and the series, as it was this wonderful game full of so many possibilities and ways of playing. It became my favorite franchise and HITMAN 2016 solidified that even more.\n\nHow would you sum up your Hitman playstyle? Are you all about speed, puzzle, roleplay, etc?\nDefinitely speed. I\u2019ve been speedrunning the game since the day it came out basically. I also love to find some crazy ways of messing around with the game\u2019s physics and inventing completely new ways to assassinate!\nAlright, now let\u2019s talk Contracts; There are thousands of out there, so how did you go about choosing the Contracts for Featuring?\u00a0\nI tried to mix a little bit. In my selection, there are speedrun focused contracts, puzzle contracts, as well as more challenging and longer contracts. I think it\u2019s good to have a good mix in contract genres to make it an interesting selection.\u00a0 The Level Menace is a wonderful contract that is a bit more complicated than it might appear at first. Come back down dude is a puzzling contract that can be completed fairly easily in a regular way, but also rewards the ones that come up with a more creative solution. The Showstopper [EX] is a really interesting contract. It\u2019s the same as the original The Showstopper but now with basically every single complication turned on. While this usually results in bad contracts, it works very well in The Showstopper, as the game gives you a ridiculous number of ways of dealing with these targets. It\u2019s a good exercise in creativity under limitations.\n\nWhat do you think are the necessary requirements to make the \u201cperfect\u201d Contract?\nIt\u2019s hard to say, honestly. There are amazing contracts of all kinds, from puzzles to speedruns, but also the longer and more challenging ones. They are all different and provide different experiences. In the end, I think, generally, a good contract will provide both a challenge and good design, but also give you enough choice and openness to let people tackle it their own way.\nMoving away from Contracts, can you remember the first time you failed an Elusive Target? What happened?\nIn the elusive target The Chameleon I threw a breaching charge into a gate. It then bounced back to me as I detonated it and it killed me. Ooops!\nSo, HITMAN 2, Are you excited?\nAbsolutely! I\u2019ve been playing Season 1 for a long time and I can\u2019t wait to see all the new things you guys have come up with since then!\nWhat are you looking forward to the most in HITMAN 2?\nI\u2019m looking forward very much for the new mechanics you have announced and also ones you have yet to announce. Some of the tools revealed so far seem like they will up the creativity even higher this time around. I hope these neat new ammo types from Sniper Assassin shows up in HITMAN 2!\n\nAre you \u201ckilling\u201d the wait with some Sniper Assassin?\nOh yes, I\u2019ve played it quite a bit. Though I want some more levels already! The introduction of bullet penetration and shockwave ammo really mix things up!\nOkay here\u2019s our last question: Where would you most like to see 47 travel to in a future game?\nIn terms of countries, I really don\u2019t have much of a preference. But in terms of settings, I\u2019d love to see maybe the following settings: Airport, shopping mall, amusement park, convention center (think of all the zany outfits!).\nIf there\u2019s anything else you want to say, now\u2019s the time\u2026\nWallbang 4 Ever!

The Surgeons will be in Hokkaido for 10 days starting at 2 pm CET on Friday the 10th\u00a0of August.\nElusive Targets are the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we\u2019ve ever created; a unique target that you\u2019ll only have one chance to eliminate. If you kill them or fail the contract, there will be no second chances.\u00a0When you\u2019re actually playing the contract, the Elusive Target will not appear on the map and will not appear in Instinct. In order to find them, you\u2019ll need to use clues from the briefing video and a photograph that you will be able to review. You\u2019ll need to explore, find your target, learn their patterns and come up with a plan to eliminate them \u2013 all whilst playing.\n\nIf you\u00a0missed\u00a0any Elusive Targets the first time around, or if you are new to HITMAN, this is your chance to experience these intense time-limited targets.\u00a0All of the suit unlocks are back in play for both new and existing players to complete their collection. If you\u2019ve already completed or failed an Elusive Target, you won\u2019t be able to play that specific contract again; your record for that contract will stand and cannot be altered.\u00a0Re-activated ET\u2019s will still be time-limited and released periodically.\nElusive Target Rewards\u00a0\nElusive Target contracts are the only way to unlock some unique suits for Agent 47, ranging from suits specific to each location in Season One to signature suits from previous games and the prestigious Winter Suit, which is only awarded to players who can complete 5 Elusive Targets with the Silent Assassin rating.\u00a0All of the suit unlocks are back in play for both new and existing players to complete their collection.\n\nIntel on ET #21 Reactivation\nThe Surgeons will be in Hokkaido for 10 days starting at 2 pm CEST on Friday the 10th. of August.

We have the newly released Summer Pack which gives you Marrakesh for FREE for a limited time! So hurry up, it won\u2019t be there forever. Also, take a look at this month\u2019s roadmap to get an overview of everything that\u2019s coming your way.\nBut now to the man of the hour.\nThis month\u2019s Community Focus star is BendingCheese67, he\u2019s a long time HITMAN fan from Portugal, and on his YouTube channel, you can really see how familiar he is with HITMAN.\nHis chosen contracts will be available to play on the 20th July 2018, and now, let\u2019s hear more about them!\nHello BendingCheese67! Can you tell us a bit about who you are?\nHey! I\u2019m just a guy who liked video games, music and spending time with my friends.\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\n\nYou can check my Youtube channel for speedruns, my twitch for livestreams and you can contact me via twitter and I\u2019m usually very active on HitmanForum.\nThis year, IOI is celebrating 20 years of making games and we\u2019d like to know about the first IOI game that you played. Can you tell us about that?\n\nFirst IOI game I played was Hitman: Absolution. There was this thing called \u201cUltimate Stealth Triple Pack\u201d for the PS3 that brought Thief, Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Hitman: Absolution.\u00a0 Later that year I bought Hitman Trilogy (Silent Assassin, Contracts &amp; Blood Money) and Codename 47. Next year HITMAN (2016) came out and I couldn\u2019t stop playing it, and that leads us here.\nHITMAN 2 has officially been announced, are you excited for November the 13th?\nYes, I am very excited about it. Can\u2019t wait to slap some people with a fish!\n\nIn HITMAN 2, what are you looking forward to the most?\nNew maps. As a speedrunner, there\u2019s nothing as good as playing a map for the first time, exploring it, figuring out a target\u2019s route, finding cool ways to kill them, etc.\nHow would you sum up your Hitman playstyle? Are you all about speed, puzzle, roleplay, etc?\nAll about speed and cool kills. I really like coming up with fast and creative Silent Assassin runs.\nAlright, now let\u2019s talk Contracts; There are thousands of out there, so how did you go about choosing your 10 Contracts for Featuring?\n\nIt was actually a simple process, I chose 10 contracts that I thought were good and had fun with, most of these are very open-wide and I\u2019m expecting to see many different players complete them in very different ways. For example, \u201cTotally legit Names\u201d is a very fun Hokkaido contract that can be completed from many different starting locations, \u00a0\u201cThe Hatch Phantasm\u201d is a simple, open and fun AHBOS (Marrakesh at Night) contract with 3 targets that allow many creativity and routes, while \u201cThe Cheese Tenacity\u201d is a hard Paris Battle Axe contract for the suit only lovers that can be quite a challenge but is still very fun.\nAwesome! What do you think are the necessary requirements to make the \u201cperfect\u201d Contract?\nWell, GuLe already mentioned most of these in his interview and I agree with what he said, contracts should be open, it doesn\u2019t have to be Any Method or Any Disguise all the time, but it shouldn\u2019t be linear or too restrictive.\nSo, moving away from Contracts, can you remember the first time you failed an Elusive Target? What happened?\nYes, I was gunned down in like 3 of them, and killed myself with explosives in a few too, in most of those, I killed myself with a Breaching Charge, that\u2019s right, a Breaching Charge LOL.\n\nHere\u2019s our last question: Where would you most like to see 47 travel to in a future game?\nPortugal. This is a country that doesn\u2019t get much recognition in video games, and there are many beautiful cities here that 47 could pay a visit to.\nIf there\u2019s anything else you want to say, now\u2019s the time\u2026\nI\u2019d like to thank the Hitman community for being so awesome! I would probably never be a curator if I hadn\u2019t joined it.\nThank you so much BendingCheese67!\nThanks to IOI for making HITMAN, for the opportunity to be the curator, and thanks to Travis and Clemens for being so awesome with the community!\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-bendingcheese67/"},

So the team set out to build a location that was both teeming with life and things to do. Marrakesh has been built with a maze of alleys, a range of souks that line the medina walls and a fully fletched shisha caf\u00e9. Moving upwards, players can enjoy the shade on the signature rooftop terraces of Marrakesh.\nJust beyond the busy marketplace, you will find an architectural marvel in the shape of the Swedish Consulate building. The very embodiment of the minimalistic Scandinavian design, a mix of glass, concrete, and wood offering a powerful contrast to the blazing heat just outside its walls.\nAs with any HITMAN level, Marrakesh promises players the lure of voyeurism and the thrill of infiltration and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working hard on getting just right. Offering two targets, the \u201cGilded Cage\u201d mission challenges players to eliminate private banker Claus Strandberg, held up inside the secure Swedish Consulate, and army General Reza Zaydan, protected by his elite squad of soldiers at a temporary headquarters in the heart of the city. Both targets will be challenging to reach and both will, of course, have some entertaining special moments attached to them that will allow players to dole out some poetic justice.\nGood luck, and have fun!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-summer-pack/"},

If you kill them or fail the contract, there will be no second chances.\u00a0When you\u2019re actually playing the contract, the Elusive Target will not appear on the map and will not appear in Instinct.

We Announced HITMAN 2, which is coming out this November. We had an action-packed E3, and much more. You can also take a look at the full monthly roadmap to get an overview of everything that\u2019s happening.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve enlisted a HITMAN player to be a Contract Curator. And this month, GuLe has stepped up to the plate to put forward his best selection of contracts for all players to enjoy.\nGuLe is a long time HITMAN fan from Argentina who knows a thing or two about HITMAN, check out his YouTube channel for a ton of awesome HITMAN videos.\nHis chosen contracts will be available to play on\u00a022nd June 2018 \u2013 so let\u2019s hear more about them!\n\nGuLe! Can you tell us a bit about who you are?\nNo, git rkt m8! jk, I\u2019m GuLe and I do HITMAN videos and will do HITMAN 2 soon huehuehue.\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\n\nMainly on my youtube channel, I have a twitch channel as well but I don\u2019t stream very often, there\u2019s also the Hitman forum and subreddit, you can always find me there, and I guess I\u2019ll drop my twitter here huehuehue.\nThis year, IOI is celebrating 20 years of making games and we\u2019d like to know about the first IOI game that you played. Can you tell us about that?\n\nMy first Hitmano game was the very first one, Codename 47, well actually it was Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, which I found on a cybercaf\u00e9, but as soon as I tried it and realized it was the second game, I decided to get a totally legit copy of the first one so I could play every game in order, Absolution wasn\u2019t out yet so I played up to Blood Money and fell in love with the series huehuehuehue.\n\nSo, HITMAN 2 has officially been announced, are you excited for November the 13th?\nYE BOIIIIIIIIII, shoutout to the absolute legend Parsime who gifted me the Gold Edition &lt;3\nHere\u2019s his youtube channel, great player.\nIn HITMAN 2, what are you looking forward to the most?\n\nNew locations! also, SA/SO/FO runs (Silent Assassin, Suit Only, Fish Only)\n\nHow would you sum up your Hitman playstyle? Are you all about speed, puzzle, roleplay, etc?\nRoleplay obviously, I like to be immersed when I play. I actually invented a whole system that\u2019s better than the Silent Assassin rating, which consists of immersion points, every time you do something immersive like not pressing the run button for 10 minutes you get points, but you lose points every time something that breaks the immersion happens. Like that time I killed The Chameleon with a flying hay bale and lost all of my immersion points.\nJust kidding! I play with every single play style, but for my videos, I prefer to go for style points mainly, speed usually comes with it so you could say I only upload the speedruns huehuehuehue.\nAlright, now let\u2019s talk Contracts; There are thousands of out there, so how did you go about choosing the 10 Contracts for Featuring?\n\nOh boy, I never thought choosing contracts would be so hard! After playing the first fifty contracts I only liked about 3 of them, and one of those 3 didn\u2019t even make it, I was very picky, but I wasn\u2019t looking for anything specific (like one in each map, or a fiber wire/sniper/melee/poison/etc. contract), as long as the contract was good that\u2019s all that matters. AND BOY, THEY WERE NOT GOOD HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE, a lot of people make the same mistakes when making a contract, which I think I can talk more about in the next question.\nLuckily it turned out to be a great batch, and it has a lot of variety as well. We have puzzles, melee, shotgun, sniping, a lot of any/any and even a flying katana contract! it\u2019s been a while since we had a flying weapon contract, people stopped doing them for some reason huehuehue.\n\n\u00a0\nSo what do you think are the necessary requirements to make the \u201cperfect\u201d Contract?\nA good contract needs to be enjoyable regarding your playstyle and have multiple solutions. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect contract, but there\u2019s a lot of things you should try to avoid when making one, so here are my pro tips for making contracts:\nThings to avoid:\n\nSingle-target contracts, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that it will become linear, which is all HITMAN isn\u2019t about.\nBonus maps, They\u2019re usually pretty bad for contracts, due to the single starting location.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be 5 targets every time, there\u2019s nothing wrong with 5 targets but you should make sure each target adds something to the contract, if it\u2019s good with 3 targets, it\u2019s good with 3 targets,\nPicking main mission targets, we already have the main mission.\nPicking all the special NPCs (Helmut, Sheikh, Sato, Dexter, Pilot, etc.), it\u2019s not only unoriginal but they\u2019re usually bad targets when they\u2019re all together in the same contract, I\u2019ve seen so many like these that I think it\u2019s worth mentioning.\nBad restrictions, restrictions are better when they\u2019re not restricting, but adding more possibilities. You might ask, how is that possible? well, a good example is one of the featured contracts from this batch, \u201cUnbearable Noise\u201d, 4 targets in Hokkaido with Suit/Shotgun restriction, that restriction made it so there\u2019s a lot of ways to do this contract, if the same targets were Any/Any, it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as interesting and everyone would probably do the same\nNote that you can break any of these rules and still make a good contract, The McVeigh Mishap is a great single-target contract, \u201cHow many takes does it take?\u201d (from this batch) is a sick puzzle contract even though it\u2019s set in The Icon, so don\u2019t avoid at all costs, but consider them huehuehue.\n\nMoving away from Contracts, can you remember the first time you failed an Elusive Target? What happened?\nI\u2019ll just let this video speak for its self:\n\nI blame Travis.\nHere\u2019s our last question: Where would you most like to see 47 travel to in a future game?\nArgentina! bring 47 to my house or RITO \u0b67\u0f3c\u0ca0\u76ca\u0ca0\u0f3d\u0b68.\nIf there is anything else you want to say, now\u2019s the time\u2026\nMendie told me I should include all of these in my interview so this is perfect:\nUuuuuuuuuuuuuhhh, wallbang, CJ, top quality contract, grm8, PEW.\nThank you so much GuLe!\nThanks to Travis for letting me pick the contracts, and to IOI for making HITMAN!\nHuehuehue.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-gule/"},

This includes support for the Anniversary Outfit Bundle and displaying the WB Games logo during the bootflow for players with the Definitive Edition.\u00a0\nNew Mission for Contracts Mode Creation\nIt is now possible to create and play Contracts on \u2018The Source\u2019 mission from the Patient Zero campaign. Contracts Search and Lookup functionality has also been added for this mission. Players will be required to own the GOTY missions to play Contracts on this location.\nThe Pharmacist\n We\u2019ve fixed an issue with \u2018The Pharmacist\u2019 Elusive Target that would cause the target to suspend their routine. This target is now back into rotation for Reactivated Elusive Targets.\nElusive Target Clarification\n We\u2019ve adjusted the messages for the Elusive Target tile on the Featured Hub to clearly show the status of the upcoming or active Elusive Target. If you have already completed or failed the contract, you will be informed of that. This will help players know whether they have previously completed or failed the contract.\nPC Framerate uncapped\nWe\u2019ve corrected an issue on PC that was introduced with the GOTY Edition that limited the framerate on PC to 100fps. The framerate will now be as high as your hardware and graphic settings will allow.\nClipping in Cover\n We\u2019ve fixed an issue that could cause 47 to get stuck in a wall, teleport or fall out of world in a staircase in Sapienza.\nMissing Vector\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue on PS4 that could cause the game to become unresponsive when resuming the game from Rest Mode during the Vector mission.\nBonus Episode Installation\nWe\u2019ve fixed an issue on PS4 that would occur when installing the game from a disc. The in-game store would display the Bonus Episode as \u2018owned\u2019 (displaying a checkbox) by default. However, the episode was not owned until a redemption voucher included in the box had been redeemed. With this change, the Bonus Episode will only show as \u2018owned\u2019 when a redemption code has been used.\nProgression Counter\n We\u2019ve fixed a visual issue with the display of Location Mastery on the location menus after reaching the max level. The game will no longer display \u201c6000 XP to next level\u201d when reaching the max level.\nFeatured Complications\n We\u2019ve made a back-end fix to Featured Contracts so that any complications for those contracts are correctly displayed. Previously, the Featured Contracts menu might display that all of the complications were activated when some of them were optional. The correct functionality was set in-game and this was purely a visual issue.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nThe May Roadmap shows all of the content coming to Hitman this month.

He\u2019s no stranger to Featured Contracts and there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ve already played at least one of his 15 contracts that have been Featured since the game launched. He also knows a thing or two about how to subdue characters.\nHis chosen contracts will be available to play on 11th May 2018, so let\u2019s hear more about them!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Hello Euler13! Tell us a bit about who you are?\nIn the real world \u2013 when I\u2019m not assassinating targets \u2013 I teach mathematics and computer science. Sad as this may sound, I am absolutely passionate about mathematics. My Gamertag is a tribute to, in my opinion, one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived, and my hero: Leonhard Euler.\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\nI have a YouTube channel: Euler13. I\u2019m also an active member of Hitman forum. I\u2019d highly recommend the forum to any Hitman players who haven\u2019t discovered it yet. It\u2019s a fantastic community and gives us a great chance to share contracts and talk all things Hitman.\nWe love the Hitman forum as well. This year, IOI is celebrating 20 years of making games and we\u2019d like to know about the first IOI game that you played. Can you tell us about that?\nEven though a day hardly goes by when I don\u2019t play Hitman 2016, my first real exposure to your games was Hitman: Absolution. I realise that this is not a view shared some of those who have been with the franchise for much longer than me, but personally, I loved Absolution. I know that a lot of my Hitman buddies share a similar experience and it was our gateway into the world of Hitman. \nFor me, it was love at first sight and the reason that I did not hesitate to pre-order Hitman 2016. I don\u2019t have a single regret. I\u2019ve been video gaming since the days of the original Atari VCS (2600), but I have never enjoyed any game as much as Hitman. I will definitely be pre-ordering season 2 as soon as it is officially announced; many of us are hoping that there will be an opportunity to begin placing our orders around 10-14 June. (c;\n\nHow would you sum up your Hitman playstyle? Are you all about speed, puzzle, roleplay, etc?\nMy playstyle has evolved and I\u2019ve dabbled with all of those mentioned. I enjoy doing speedruns from time to time and I cannot resist a good puzzle contact, but my prefence is a self-imposed suit only infiltration style of play, even if the contract allows any disguise. There is nothing quite like the adrenaline rush experienced when sneaking through a hostile map such as Colorado in my favorite 47\u2019s Signature suit with gloves. But even suit only runs open up so many options. Recently I did a video series: Shabby 47 vs Smooth 47, in which I completed two suit only runs of all of the main missions using two different playstyles. \nSmooth 47 operates like a ghost, never subdues anyone, and does nothing that would create panic. Shabby 47 will settle for nothing less than silent assassin rating, but he\u2019s bold, loud, and will go to any lengths to get the job done.\nAlright, now let\u2019s talk Contracts; There are thousands of out there, so how did you go about choosing the 10 Contracts for Featuring?\u00a0\nMy personal favourites are generally those with one, two, or three carefully chosen targets. However, when I chose these contracts to be featured I was acutely aware that they were going to be played by an entire community of players with such a massive variety of preferences. So I\u2019ve tried to pick something for everyone and, contrary to my preferences, a lot of them have five targets. But I hope that those who play them will appreciate how much thought each of the creators has put into their design.\nWhen selecting them I knew that there needed to be a complete mixture of those I\u2019d categorise as free-flowing speedrun, puzzle, and infiltration. I also had to try to give coverage to most of the maps and allow for different skill levels. Although it\u2019s only my opinion, I rated the difficulty level of all the contracts that I chose out of 10 (with 10 being the most difficult) and the mean score was 6.2. And, yes, there is one in there that I\u2019d rate as a 10! I\u2019m sure that everyone will quickly figure it out which one it is and curse me for selecting, but I think it\u2019s a real masterpiece. Some seasoned players might feel that there are too many easy contracts, but I deliberately chose a number of them because they allowed for any kill method and any disguise. So if it\u2019s too easy, then they will have the freedom to make it challenging for themselves and hopefully they can share a video of their insanely good runs to impress the rest of us.\nWhat do you think are the necessary requirements to make the \u201cperfect\u201d Contract?\nAgain, this is often down to personal opinion, but I do think that there are some fundamental principles that are the hallmark of great contracts. When searching for random contracts to play I tend to ignore any with the default title (Kill Order\u2026) and briefing (You have been cleared\u2026). It doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be great, but if I don\u2019t know the creator, then it is most likely that someone who can\u2019t be bothered to take the time to think of a decent title or briefing has probably not thought much about the targets and kill conditions either. They probably just went into the map and marked five random targets and would have marked twenty targets if the game allowed it.\n In other words, an excellent contract should show clear evidence that the creator had a theme in mind, he/she had thought carefully about the targets, and had considered how they should be killed. The contract should be tested several times before publishing and the creator should take the time to think about how other players will approach it. I believe that getting that balance between challenge, fun, and freedom is what it\u2019s all about.\n\nThat\u2019s Awesome. Moving away from Contracts, can you remember the first time you failed (if ever) an Elusive Target? What happened?\nI\u2019ve never failed an Elusive Target, but I did miss out on silent assassin rating with a couple of the earlier ones the first time round. One of my all-time favourites was The Prince. I still remember starting it with a confident \u201cI\u2019m coming for you\u201d swagger and being horrified when I found the church in complete lockdown. I knew the Sapienza map inside out, but I soon realised that would count for nothing. I was going to need a really good plan. I still don\u2019t know what I did wrong, but somehow, someone, somewhere saw me. The other ET that I didn\u2019t get silent assassin on was the enjoyable and hilarious Gary Busey contract. I used a ducky on a scooter and the explosion of the duck killed him rather than the scooter, so it didn\u2019t count as an accident kill. Schoolboy error!\nWhen IOI first announced Elusive Targets, none of us really knew what to expect, but I\u2019m sure that I speak for the vast majority of the community in saying that they turned out to be an unexpectedly awesome experience. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get more in season 2.\nWe have one last question for you: Where would you most like to see 47 travel to in a future game?\nI\u2019m not really too bothered about geographical location as much as the type of map. I think that a prison complex would be really interesting to explore. This could include areas like the prison cells, facilities (toilets, showers, laundary, kitchens, and so on), hidden passages and tunnels, warden and administrator offices, and prison guard areas. The default starting location could be outside the prison and you would need to break-in. The main target(s) could be The King Pin and/or a corrupt warden.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything else you want to say, now\u2019s the time\u2026\nI\u2019d like to shout out a massive thanks to the entire team at IOI who have lovingly brought us Hitman and continue to nurture this wonderful game. I would also like to thank the Hitman community for being so amazing, especially all the friends that I have made. They are the best. Most will go out their way to help and encourage others to become that perfect assassin. Yes, we have our disagreements from time to time, but ultimately it\u2019s a fantastic community who all share the same love for the greatest game ever.\nThank you so much for your time Euler13!\nNo, thank you, and the best of luck with everything that lies ahead.\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-euler13/"},

{"title": "20 Years of IOI", "date": "April 4, 2018", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThis year marks a milestone anniversary for us and it\u2019s one that we want to celebrate: IOI is 20 years old!\nWe\u2019ve been making games for two decades and have released 11 games from four different franchises. It feels incredible to say that and look back at everything that we\u2019ve achieved along the way.\nIn 2000, we introduced Agent 47 to the world with Codename 47 and established his legacy as a Silent Assassin two years later. Then, we released Freedom Fighters in 2003 and gave our take on an alternative history in New York before returning to 47 with the atmospheric Hitman Contracts and then Blood Money in 2006.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the following three years, we introduced another two franchises. First, Kane &amp; Lynch. The world\u2019s most notorious criminals blasted their way through two titles \u2013 with the release of Mini Ninjas firmly placed between them. After a 6-year break, Agent 47 returned in Hitman: Sniper Challenge and Absolution, on new technology and with a very personal story. Now, we\u2019re still supporting HITMAN (2016, All Caps) with monthly content and love more than two years after its initial launch.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the entire release history of our games in two paragraphs. We want to give each game a lot more love throughout the rest of the year \u2013 and we\u2019ll be doing that with artwork, livestreams, interviews and much more. Look for announcements on Twitter and Facebook.\nToday, we\u2019re hard at work. We\u2019ve got plenty cooking and the pots are still boiling. Please don\u2019t read too much into the analogy. We just thought of it and we\u2019re sticking with it. We think you know what we\u2019re saying.\n\n\u00a0\nWe want to use this blog post to share some other great news with you!\nHITMAN now has more than 12 million players!\nThat\u2019s in bold because we\u2019re so proud to say it! We\u2019re humbled and excited to see so many players enjoying the game!\nHere\u2019s another incredible milestone: Last week, we set a new all-time record for the most active users in a single day. We had to spin up our server capacity to meet demand.\nBack in 2015 when we announced HITMAN, we talked about building an expanding and evolving world of assassination. These numbers prove to us that we\u2019re pulling that off and we\u2019re inspired to continue creating content that our players will want to play and experience.\u00a0Obviously, that number was helped by our Spring Pack, which was available for a limited time. This download allowed anyone to play Sapienza, the beautiful Italian coastaltown and one of the most highly-praised locations from HITMAN.\nIt\u2019s great to see so many people playing our game, liking it and wanting more of it, which is great support for us. As an independent studio, that is very important. Whenever you started playing the game, we appreciate all the support. Thank you.\nLooking *slightly* to the future\nAs part of our anniversary celebrations, we\u2019re excited to announce that HITMAN: Definitive Edition will be released on May 15th for Xbox One and PS4!\nComing exclusively to store shelves, HITMAN: Definitive Edition includes all episodes and locations from Season One plus all of the Game of the Year Edition content, including the Patient Zero campaign!\u00a0We\u2019ve partnered with Warner Bros. to release the Definitive Edition. They\u2019ll be publishing and distributing this version of the game to store shelves all over the world.\nWe\u2019re tying our studio anniversary and the upcoming Definitive Edition release with a new outfit bundle that celebrates our history. Introducing\u2026 The Anniversary Outfit Bundle!\n\nThese new outfits are inspired by the games that we\u2019ve made here at IOI; Freedom Fighters, Kane &amp; Lynch and Mini Ninjas!\nThe Freedom Phantom Suit is inspired by Christopher Stone from Freedom Fighters.\nGet ready to take command and fight for freedom in a suit that is equal parts charismatic and rebellious.\nThe Lynch Suit is inspired by everybody\u2019s favourite criminal; Lynch.\nIt\u2019s the perfect suit for an impulsive, reckless and self-medicated psychopath.\nThe Futo Suit is inspired by Futo from Mini Ninjas.\nAs you know, Ninjas always operate alone but they don\u2019t always fight using a hammer. Futo does.\nThe Anniversary Outfit bundle will be made available for purchase on digital platforms later this year.\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of what\u2019s included in HITMAN: Definitive Edition\n\nAnniversary Outfit Bundle \u2013 Three new outfits inspired by IOI games; Freedom Fighters, Kane &amp; Lynch and Mini Ninjas\nHITMAN Season One \u2013 Seven exotic locations from the first season, including Paris, Sapienza, Marrakesh, Bangkok, Colorado and Hokkaido, along with the ICA Facility\nHITMAN\u00a0Game of the Year Edition Content\u00a0\u2013 Four missions from the Patient Zero Campaign, three themed Escalation Contracts that unlock three unique weapons, as well as the Clown Suit, Cowboy Suit and Raven Suit\nHITMAN Bonus Episode \u2013 Featuring 3 Bonus Missions in Sapienza and Marrakesh\nHITMAN: Blood Money Requiem Pack \u2013 Including the Requiem Suit, Pale Duck Explosive and ICA Chrome Pistol\nAll Featured\u00a0Contracts, Escalation Contracts, Challenge Packs and game updates from HITMAN Season One and HITMAN Game of the Year Edition\n\n\u00a0\nBOOM!

{"title": "Community Focus \u2013 JetBlackIris", "date": "March 28, 2018", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tTwenty eighteen is rolling by and we\u2019re already into March! About time for some Curated Contracts!\nAll Curated Contracts are chosen by a different member of the HITMAN community each month. They cherry pick the best contracts on offer from other players and we publish them alongside the Featured Contracts for all players. They say that you really get to know a person depending on the contracts that they curate. Let\u2019s find out if that\u2019s true\u2026\nOur curator for March is an Oscar-nominated director/producer from Toronto, whose had some of his own Contracts in the Featured list before. Now he\u2019s on the other side of the fence are curating 10 contracts that\u00a0will be live in the game on March 28 on all platforms!\n\u00a0\nHello JetBlackIris!\nHey guys!\nCan you tell us a bit about who you are?\nIn the real world, I\u2019m a journalist and filmmaker. As a journo, I\u2019ve written for a whole bunch of different newspapers and magazines, mostly covering the entertainment industry. As a filmmaker, I wrote, directed and produced the HBO film Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah, and am in development now on my second movie. And, of course, I\u2019m also a long-time Hitman fan, going back to Contracts.\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\nWell, I\u2019m on HitmanForum and YouTube as JetBlackIris, or you can find the real me on Twitter @AdamBenzine.\nYou\u2019ve already had some of your own Contracts \u2018featured\u2019, which one are you most happy with?\nI think I\u2019d go with Fall Season Preview \u2013 it was my first to be featured, it was challenging to a lot of players, and it embraced my love of puns in the title! You essentially had to push five targets to their death, however some players found a way around that by KO\u2019ing targets and dumping them. Now that there is a \u2018no KOs\u2019 restriction, perhaps I should remake it?\n\nHow did you go about picking the contracts to be featured \u2013 and how do you feel about your final choices?\nI wanted to be transparent about the process, so I opened it up to players on HitmanForum for discussion. I encouraged a conversation among players. I made clear specifically what I was looking for \u2013 a strong sniper contract, a puzzle contract, a fibre-wire contract, a loud and messy contract, etc \u2013 but I was also open to other players\u2019 favourites. I\u2019m happy with the 10 I\u2019ve chosen \u2013 it\u2019s quite hard to design contracts now, because the maps and NPC routes are very well-known to players, but these ones are all pretty great. \nGraduation \u2013 From Candidate to Agent is a fantastic fibre-wire contract on the ICA Facility Map from a relative newcomer; Shooter is a great sniping contract; Dead Presidents and Backpack Runners make smart use of little-observed NPC details, which I love; and Bangkok Ninja is a challenging puzzle. Finally, and perhaps a little indulgently, I dropped one of my own very special contracts into the mix as well, which I hope agents will enjoy.\nHow would you sum up your HITMAN playstyle? Are you all about speed, stealth, roleplaying \u2013 or something else entirely?\nDefinitely I prefer the role-play aspect of it. I grew up loving assassin movies such as The Day of the Jackal, Grosse Point Blank, The Bourne Identity and The Living Daylights, and as such I like to be immersed in the mission. No disrespect to those who love speed-running \u2013 and there are plenty of players who do \u2013 but to me it seems anathema to the whole notion of being a contract killer. Especially as that play style often involves running around and causing as much noise and chaos as you can to distract from the kill. I prefer to be slow and methodical. \nOften on a user contract, I\u2019ll go back to get my suit at the end, even though I don\u2019t need to, simply because that\u2019s what 47 would do.\nLooking back at the now-more-than-two-years of HITMAN, what single moment stands out for you?\nI think when Sapienza dropped, everyone\u2019s mind was kind of blown. We were already impressed with the Paris map, but Sapienza felt like an entire coastal seaside town, and really demonstrated the possibilities of the game in a quite spectacular way.\nIf that\u2019s the past, let\u2019s look to the future. What do you hope to see in Agent 47\u2019s futures adventures?\nI like and support the episodic model, it adds longevity to the game. I\u2019d love to see missions in London, New York, Tokyo, Rio and Las Vegas. Three of the six maps from season one (Paris, Bangkok, Hokkaido) were essentially single, enclosed buildings, so I\u2019d like to see more open city maps with street crowds, like Sapienza and Marrakesh. I also hope for a few new, inventive game modes, beyond Elusive Targets and Featured Contracts.\nAlso, this is kind of specific, but I\u2019d love to see a small mission set aboard a large commercial airplane with limited movement, hiding spaces and weapon availability. You could have restricted movement between economy class, business class, a first class upper deck and the pilot cabin, but with plenty of poisoning and fibre-wire kill possibilities. I actually really liked some of those smaller, interstitial missions and maps in Absolution.\nIf there\u2019s anything else you want to say, the stage is yours\u2026\nCarrying a golf club through a five-star hotel is suspicious, but carrying a crowbar isn\u2019t? Really? \ud83d\ude09\nOn a serious note, you guys at IOI have done a great job with the game, you really have. There is nothing else out on the market like it. You should be exceptionally proud. Roll on season two!\nThanks JetBlackIris!\nThank you.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-jetblackiris/"},

That\u2019ll be the first chance for many of you to earn the Summer Suit with Gloves. See below for a full list of the unlockable suits that are rewarded by completing Elusive Targets.\nIn between those re-activated Elusive Targets, we will also release 10 new Featured Contracts on January 18. Pulling the best contracts that are shared within the Hitman community and putting them front and centre for all players to enjoy.\n\nNext month, we\u2019ll be re-introducing our Curated Contracts. These Contracts function in the same way as Featured Contracts \u2013 but they are chosen by one member of the community.\nFind out who\u2019s lined up for the task with the February Roadmap, where we\u2019ll also have dates for the next re-activated Elusive Targets.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-january-roadmap/"},

Until this point, we\u2019ve not been keeping track of exactly who was at the top of that leaderboard.\nIt was a close run thing, decided by just one contract, but we do have someone standing at the top of the pile; the next Contract Curator is Quinez. There\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ve played one of his Featured Contracts already. Here\u2019s the list: Too Many Claudios, Blindness and Sight, Cappin\u2019 Cap\u2019ns, Aquacadabra, Explosive Secrets, Foretold, Sniper Mario, Stay Outside the Fence, Plywood and Paste, and A Crossed Swords Puzzle.\nNow, we\u2019re ready to find out more about him and the Contracts that he\u2019s chosen to be featured \u2013 they went live in the game on November 30!\nHello Quinez!\nHi!\u00a0 I\u2019m very pleased to be here.\nCan you give us some intel on who you are?\nI work in academia, and my research is on emotional disorders and psychosis.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been obsessed with puzzles and game mechanics.\u00a0 Hitman is a perfect sandbox for creating puzzles inside a really fun game, so I quickly took to contract creation.\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\nI post on Hitman Forum under the name Quine, I post on Reddit under the name Quinez, and I also have a YouTube channel where I occasionally post runs.\nOk, let\u2019s really get to you know; fibre wire or silverballer?\nSilverballer for sure.\u00a0 Fibre wire is classic, but it\u2019s one-note.\u00a0 The Silverballer lets you do cool tricks, like shooting down chandeliers, distracting bystanders with bullet holes, or making tricky shots through windows that usually go unnoticed. It\u2019s the weapon of choice for the puzzle-minded. \n\nHow did you go about choosing the 10 contracts?\nI chose a mix of old contracts that have always stuck with me along with new contracts that use the new complications.\u00a0 Overall, I wanted to showcase Contracts that I think manifest excellent design decisions.\u00a0 Let me pick out a couple of the older contracts I chose and talk about why I think they\u2019re noteworthy:\nElite Sniper: Church Tower is one of my favorite sniper contracts.\u00a0 To make a good sniper contract, you need to find targets who can be sniped without the bodies being discovered, and you need to encourage the player to do long-range shots. This contract from BernardoOne asks you to make some truly diabolical shots from Sapienza\u2019s church tower. The GOTY patch made some changes to sniping that makes this contract a lot easier than it used to be, but the contract is still very satisfying.\nThe Retroviral Revengeance is simple and clean: kill Silvio and Francesca while dressed in the hazmat suit.\u00a0 It\u2019s a perfect example of a \u201croulette style\u201d contract that just adds extra objectives to a story mission. \u00a0These kinds of contracts can be really strong, but the problem is in getting the objectives just right. If they\u2019re too restrictive then the mission becomes linear and boring, but if they\u2019re not restrictive enough then they just add a little busywork without really affecting the gameplay. This is one that I think really works. It changes how the level plays while still requiring thought and creativity. \u00a0Nakar, the creator, even suggests a couple of optional bonus objectives:\nBONUS: Poison both targets. This includes regular poison, the Prototype Virus Sample, and the hazardous gas in the containment room.\nSUPER BONUS: Never have line of sight to either target.\nYou mentioned the new Contract Complications that were recently added to Contracts Mode. As you\u2019re the first curator to use them, how much did that affect your choices for Featured Contracts?\nI\u2019m really excited about the new complications.\u00a0 Contract creators have wanted them for a long time, and now we have them!\u00a0 Creators are still getting their feet wet, exploring what the complications make possible, but there are already some gems out there that I\u2019ve chosen to feature.\u00a0 Urben\u2019s \u2018Alley Bully\u2019 makes you hide bodies where there aren\u2019t any obvious places to hide them.\u00a0 Coastercraft\u2019s \u2018Easy at First Glance\u2019 asks you to sneak all throughout the hospital while dressed as a ninja.\u00a0 BlazingSky\u2019s \u2018Surgical Precision\u2019 makes you clear out a crowded surgery room without using any legshots.\u00a0 Beware security cameras!\nLooking back at your own Featured Contracts, which one do you think is the best?\nThis is a tough call.\u00a0 It\u2019s not the best contract \u2013 lots of players hated it \u2013 but the most fun I had was when Blindness and Sight was selected.\u00a0 Pros and speedrunners tore their hair out trying to figure out how to complete it with a Silent Assassin rating, with many saying it was impossible.\u00a0 Eventually, a 30 minute run was found, and the time was then gradually whittled to 5 minutes.\u00a0 Players now understand the game too well for something like this to ever happen again, I think.\nForetold might be the best.\u00a0 It\u2019s simple in concept: in Marrakesh at night, snipe the fortune teller in your suit.\u00a0 It\u2019s evocative, and I think the briefing is especially strong.\u00a0 The runs that emerged were fascinating.\u00a0 The solution \u00a0I intended is shown here by Euler13: it requires making a blind shot through curtains after breaking the smoke machine with a breaching charge so that the fortune-teller can\u2019t turn it off.\u00a0 (That\u2019s something even the level designer didn\u2019t realize was possible!)\u00a0 But the contract inspired plenty of other mystifying and hilarious runs.\nI like that Stay Outside the Fence asks you to do something original and turns the game into a shooting gallery.\u00a0 And I think Sniper Mario is a strong sniper contract.\nWe\u2019ve also recently re-activated Elusive Targets, is there one particular moment from an ET that stands out for you?\nProbably The Bookkeeper, one of my two failures.\u00a0 At that point I had already unlocked all the suits, so I decided to have some fun.\u00a0 I tried to catch the target in the blast from Sean Rose\u2019s watch bomb.\u00a0 But I mistimed it, and chaos ensued.\nElusive targets cause my hands to sweat and shake like nothing else.\u00a0 They\u2019re brilliant.\nNow is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. Have at it!\nAnother bit of fan creation I like to do is write up design documents for imaginary Hitman levels.\u00a0 I\u2019ve written fantasy missions set at a Swiss pharma company, a\u00a0 North Korean internment compound, a Hong Kong shopping mall\u00a0and an Icelandic whaling village.\nI\u2019ve also written up a bonus mission set in Bangkok\u00a0and a very speculative outline for what Season 2 could look like.\u00a0 Please check them out! \nThanks Quinez!\nThanks to you!\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-quinez/"},

During the maintenance period, all players will receive the GOTY Game Update/Patch. The update size will be approximately 4-5GB, depending on platform and will update the game version to 1.13.0.\nHITMAN GOTY Edition and the GOTY Upgrade will be available for purchase starting from 12pm UTC on November 7th for PC, Xbox One and PS4 EU. For PS4 players in the US, the GOTY Edition and GOTY Upgrade will be available for purchase at 3pm UTC, or 8am PST.\nIt may take some time for the items to appear in the stores. If the items appear on the digital stores before the expected release times mentioned above, you will be able to purchase the GOTY content but you will be unable to launch the content until you have successfully installed the 1.13.0 update of the game. Please make sure you have updated your game to version 1.13.0 before attempting to play the new content.\nWe will post updates throughout the day about maintenance and availability to our Twitter account: @IOInteractive\n\u00a0\nHITMAN \u2013 GOTY Content Overview (New Content)\n\nNew Campaign: Patient Zero\n\n4 new missions: The Source, The Author, The Vector, Patient Zero\u00a0\nAfter the routine elimination of a target, a contingency plan to unleash a global pandemic is triggered and Agent 47 must race against the clock to prevent a virus from spreading. This four-mission campaign spans different locations in the game, each one re-worked from the original settings with new gameplay opportunities, disguises, characters, challenges, gameplay mechanics, AI behaviour and HUD elements. Due to the dynamic nature of the Patient Zero missions, they are not available for Contract creation.\n\n\n\n\n\n3 New Escalation Contracts\n\nThe Cheveyo Calibration (Marrakesh by night),\u00a0The Corky Commotion (Paris), The Dexter Discordance (Hokkaido)\nWe\u2019ve created a new Escalation Contract for each new weapon/suit combination with some brand new complications based on new gameplay mechanics. We\u2019ve themed these new features with each suit to make for some unique experiences. All of the Escalations are made up of 3-stages, so expect the challenge to ramp up quickly and completing each one will unlock the corresponding weapon to be used in all locations across the entire game.\n\n\n3 New Weapons\n\nA New Bat \u2013 Corky the Clown\u2019s signature weapon that triggers custom sound and visual effects every time it is used.\nSieger 300 Ghost \u2013\u00a0\u00a0an all-black sniper rifle\u00a0with a supressor, 4x zoom and the Marksman perk, which allows you to improve your aim and slow time.\nStriker \u2013\u00a0a magnum pistol with increased damage at all ranges, knocks back targets\u00a0and\u00a0has piercing rounds.\n\n\n3 New Outfits\n\nClown \u2013\u00a0Corky the Clown is back! This fan-favourite from Blood Money returns in HITMAN and his red wig, colourful socks and giant shoes look better than ever!\nCowboy \u2013 The Cowboy suit comes complete with a beautiful set of albino alligator boots, sunglasses and a cowboy hat as pure as Colorado snow.\nRaven \u2013 The perfect choice for Agent 47\u2019s sniper operations, the Raven Suit is black and charcoal with the finest gloves and pockets for every tool.\n\n\n40+ Patient Zero-specific challenges\n\n\u00a0\nReminder: There are two options for getting all of this new content, depending on what you already own.\nNew Players:\u00a0HITMAN \u2013 GOTY Edition will be available digitally for $60. That includes The Complete First Season plus all of our new GOTY content.\nExisting Players:\u00a0If you already own The Complete First Season, either digitally or on disc, the \u2018GOTY Upgrade\u2019\u00a0includes all of the new GOTY content and will be available digitally for $20.\n (The $20 GOTY Upgrade is also available to anyone who purchased\u00a0all\u00a0episodes individually or previously purchased the Intro Pack/Upgrade Pack combination.)\nPlease note that on November 7th, The Complete First Season will no longer be available for purchase digitally and will be replaced by the GOTY Edition as the default offering for new HITMAN players. We\u2019ve made this change in order to further simplify the purchasing options now that all of the content for Season One has been released. Individual episodes will remain available for purchase in-game on consoles \u2013 and on Steam via the bundle set-up.\nUpdate: Individual episodes are no longer available for individual purchase on consoles. We\u2019ve made this change to drastically simplify the purchasing options for existing console players that do not own all episodes.\u00a0With this change, console players that do not own all episodes should purchase one of the \u201cGOTY Upgrade\u201d options via the in-game store tab. We\u2019ve made some behind-the-scenes changes to these options to make sure all players can access the correct upgrade options, based on whether they own the digital or disc version of the game.\nThis approach makes it much easier to understand what is needed to upgrade to the GOTY Edition from many different constellations of owned episodes. If you need more guidance, please refer to this guide on the fan-run Hitman Forum.\nThe Steam bundle set-up remains unchanged. For clarity, the options for new players and existing players (who own all episodes through the Complete First Season) also remain unchanged.\n\u00a0\nHITMAN \u2013 GOTY Update/Patch Release Notes (for all players)\n\nA redesigned UI with a new colour scheme and visual style\nA fresh new look across the board and re-organised menus to make it easier to find what you\u2019re looking for.\nDefault Loadout\n For each mission, choose the loadout that you want to use on the Planning page and save it. Next time you load that mission, your default loadout will be ready and waiting.\nBullet Distractions\n As part of an ongoing review into core gameplay mechanics, we\u2019ve increased the range that NPC\u2019s will hear bullet impacts from 1.9 metres to 5 metres. We feel that this is a more believable distance and will allow for more creative gameplay scenarios.\nMajor lighting improvements to all missions\nNew colour grading, readjusted HDR adaptation rules and re-designed skyboxes mean that all of our locations look more vivid, vibrant and lifelike.\u00a0The image below shows the \u2018Club 27\u2019 mission in Bangkok with these new improvements. Click on it to open a higher-res version.\n\nSniper Rifle Audio\n Our Audio Team have been looking at improving the weapon sounds and have started with the Sniper Rifle, specifically the Sieger 300. Their goals were to make this Sniper feel more powerful and to achieve that, they\u2019ve reworked the sound from the ground up with new source assets, new audio processing and a new implementation. The Sieger 300 Advanced and the Sieger 300 Ghost will also benefit from these improvements.\nSpeaker Configuration\nWe\u2019ve added an option in the Settings Menu to configure your speaker set-up. There are three options and the game audio will mix accordingly; Surround (Default), Headphones and Stereo.\nElusive Target Re-activation\nStarting in November, we will re-activate Elusive Targets. If you\u00a0missed\u00a0any Elusive Targets the first time around, or if you are new to HITMAN, this is your chance to experience these intense time-limited targets.\u00a0All of the suit unlocks are back in play for both new and existing players to complete their collection. If you\u2019ve already completed or failed an Elusive Target, you won\u2019t be able to play that specific contract again; your record for that contract will stand and cannot be altered.\u00a0Re-activated ET\u2019s will still be time-limited and the first one will be re-activated shortly after the release of our Game of the Year Edition on November 7th.\nCommemorative Elusive Target Unlock\n If you played any of the Elusive Targets we released during Season One, we have created a small in-game reward that will only be available to a limited number of players. You\u2019ll be awarded one of three coins, depending on your progress with Elusive Targets during their first activation. Progress is measured against simply playing an Elusive Target contract, successfully completing any Elusive Target contract and earning the Silent Assassin rating on an ET contract. The item will be granted when launching the game for the first time with the GOTY Update/Patch.\nStore Tab\n We\u2019ve added a \u2018Store\u2019 tab to the menu to make it easier to; check which content you have installed, purchase episodes or upgrade to the new GOTY content directly through the game.\nContracts Discoverability\n \u2013 \u2018Trending\u2019 helps you find the most popular contracts, making sure you can easily find a new challenge.\n \u2013 \u2018Most Played Last Week\u2019 tracks the Contracts with the most plays in the last 7 days.\nContracts Text Search Operators\n Use search operators to find titles or descriptions of created contracts.\nContract Complications\n We\u2019re adding \u201cComplications\u201d to Contracts Mode, such as restricting disguise changes or requiring players to use a specific exit. Anyone who creates a contract will be able to toggle these conditions to set a more defined challenge for their contract.\nThe complications can either be set as an \u2018optional\u2019 or \u2018required\u2019 and the Contract creator will need to make sure that they \u2018achieve\u2019 each condition when creating their contract. If any \u2018required\u2019 objectives are failed, you will immediately fail the mission.\nHere\u2019s the full list of Complications:\n\nTime Limit\nRequired Exit (Cannot be used as an optional objective)\nTargets Only\nDo Not Get Spotted\nNo Bodies Found\nHide all Bodies\nNo Disguise Changes\nHeadshots Only\nNo Missed Shots\nNo Pacifications\nNo Recordings\n\nRed Targets\nThe mini map and full map will now highlight targets in red. Previously, they were white.\nDeath Screen\nTo savour the moment of failing a contract or mission by dying, the \u2018Mission Failed\u2019 screen will no longer fade to black and will instead show 47\u2019s last moment (before replaying).\nXbox One X Enhancements\nHITMAN \u2013 Game of the Year Edition is enhanced for Xbox One X. Featuring beautiful native 4K, a smooth as butter 60 FPS high frame rate mode and HDR support for vivid and stunning colors.\n Watch the glorious new trailer that shows all of these enhancements, plus a few early looks at the Patient Zero missions right here:\n\nTobii Eye Tracking support [PC Only]\nEnhance your killer instincts with Dynamic Light Adaptation, Extended View, Clean UI and a new special feature added specifically for HITMAN.

This change was made on PC with update 1.12.2.\nPatient Zero Support\n We\u2019ve added many features that will support the Patient Zero campaign. We are being purposefully vague because detailing them would spoil the experience.\u00a0This includes the new HUD elements, gameplay mechanics and AI behaviour that we mentioned when we announced the GOTY Edition.\nFixed Issues\nGlobal Issues\n\nFixed an issue that could cause NPC\u2019s to hear silenced gunshots through walls.\nFixed an issue that could cause the \u2018compromised\u2019 state to trigger when using a syringe on a guard whilst remaining unseen.\nFixed an issue where the Winter Suit would not cast the proper shadows in some locations.\nFixed an issue that could cause NPC\u2019s to get stuck in the ground when \u2018dumped\u2019 from height.\nFixed an issue where the Fast Target option would occasionally place the crosshair above the intended target.\n\nParis\n\nFixed a few minor issues on the Holiday Hoarders mission.\nFixed a few minor issues with character animation during opportunities.\n\nSapienza\n\nFixed an issue that could make it impossible for 47 to interact with the Robot Arm, depending on what items are equipped.\nFixed an issue that could cause the sun to show incorrect textures when in focus.\nFixed an issue that could cause the church bell to respawn.\nFixed a handful of issues with Abbiatti\u2019s routine in the Landslide mission.\n\nBangkok\n\nFixed an issue where all NPC\u2019s could be lured to room 207 using a clock radio.\nFixed an issue where the \u2018Sticky Hatchet\u2019 complication in the Arthin Occulation Escalation might not function properly.\nFixed an issue that could cause Jordan Cross to suspend his routine or repeat conversations, depending on 47\u2019s actions.\n\nColorado\n\nFixed an issue where the map would show incorrect information about level geometry.\n\nHokkaido\n\nFixed an issue that could cause items to fall \u2018out of world\u2019 in specific circumstances.\nFixed an issue where Ninja 47 could get stuck on the roof.

All seven locations, all bonus missions, all of the Challenge Packs, Escalation Contracts, Featured Contracts and more than 700 challenges! We\u2019re talking more than 100 hours of gameplay and a game that we\u2019re continuing to improve. See below for more of that.\nNew: Patient Zero Campaign\nAfter the routine elimination of a target, a contingency plan to unleash a global pandemic is triggered and Agent 47 must race against the clock to prevent a virus from spreading. This four-mission campaign spans different locations in the game, each one re-worked from the original settings with new gameplay opportunities, disguises, characters, challenges, gameplay mechanics, AI behaviour and HUD elements. Bangkok, Sapienza, Colorado and Hokkaido look and feel completely different with a new time of day and new custom music created by the composer for Season One, Niels Bye Nielsen.\n\nNew: Clown Suit and \u2018A New Bat\u2019\nCorky the Clown is back! This fan-favourite from Blood Money returns in HITMAN and his red wig, colourful socks and giant shoes look better than ever! Not only does the clown suit look great, but it\u2019s the only way to carry his signature weapon without attracting attention. \u2018A New Bat\u2019 will trigger custom sound and visual effects every time it is used.\nNew: Raven Suit and \u2018Sieger 300 Ghost\u2019\nWhere tactical meets practical and stylish, you\u2019ll find the Raven Suit. This is the perfect choice for Agent 47\u2019s sniper operations. The Raven Suit is black and charcoal with the finest gloves and pockets for every tool. The Sieger 300 Ghost is a unique ICA variant of the Sieger 300 and the all-black rifle perfectly matches the Raven Suit for high-precision, high-damage long-range engagements. It\u2019s got a supressor, an extended scope with four levels of zoom and the Marksman perk, which allows you to improve your aim and slow time.\nNew: Cowboy Suit and \u2018The Striker\u2019\nThe Cowboy suit is steel blue on patriotic white and comes complete with a beautiful set of albino alligator boots, sunglasses and a cowboy hat as pure as Colorado snow. Naturally, the belt buckle is the size of your fist. Accompanying this suit is\u00a0The Striker; a magnum pistol that packs one hell of a punch. Not only does it have increased damage at all ranges, it also knocks back targets and has piercing rounds.\n\nNew: Themed Escalation Contracts\nThere\u2019s more! We\u2019ve created a new Escalation Contract for each new weapon/suit combination. You\u2019ll be dressing in each new suit and using each new weapon as you complete Escalation Contracts with some brand new complications based on some new gameplay mechanics. We\u2019ve themed these new features with each suit to make for some unique experiences.\nEach Escalation comes with a new starting location unique to that Contract and all of the Escalations are made up of 3-stages, so expect the challenge to ramp up quickly- one of the Escalations reaches 7 targets, something we\u2019ve never done before in this game. Completing each Escalation Contract will unlock the corresponding weapon to be used in all locations across the entire game, which means that Clown Only, Striker Only runs are now possible and we can\u2019t wait to see them!\n\nHere\u2019s how to get your hands on the GOTY Edition\n\nHITMAN \u2013 Game of the Year Edition will be available digitally on November 7th 2017 for PS4, Xbox One and PC.\nNew Players: HITMAN \u2013 GOTY Edition will be available digitally for $60.

We will share the full details of the game update soon, but here\u2019s some of the highlights ahead of time:\n\u2013 A redesigned UI with a new colour scheme and visual style\nA fresh new look across the board and re-organised menus to make it easier to find what you\u2019re looking for.\n\u2013 New Contracts Mode features\n\u2018Trending\u2019 helps you find the most popular contracts, making sure you can easily find a new challenge.

If you missed any Elusive Targets the first time around, or if you are new to HITMAN, this is your chance to experience these intense time-limited targets.\u00a0All of the suit unlocks are back in play for both new and existing players to complete their collection. If you\u2019ve already completed or failed an Elusive Target, you won\u2019t be able to play that specific contract again; your record for that contract will stand and cannot be altered.\u00a0Re-activated ET\u2019s will still be time-limited and the first one will be re-activated shortly after the release of our Game of the Year Edition on November 7th.\n\u00a0\nWow.

{"title": "Community Focus \u2013 Hatch", "date": "October 19, 2017", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCurated Contracts in HITMAN are all about giving our community the chance to pick out some of the best contracts and getting them Featured for all players to enjoy. Each month, we ask one member of the community to pick out 10 contracts and we add them to the list of Featured Contracts in-game.\nOur next Contract Curator is here! His name is Hatch and he was tasked with picking out 10 of the best contracts that the community have created. Luckily, he agreed.\nNow, we\u2019re ready to find out more about him and the contracts that he\u2019s chosen to be featured \u2013 they\u2019ll be live in the game on October 20th!\nHello Hatch!\nHello IOI and Hitman fans.\nCan you give us some intel on who you are?\nI am a 29 year old Graphic Designer and long-time Hitman fan. I have been playing Hitman pretty much since its inception and I am currently loving HITMAN (2016), which got me into speedrunning. Around 18 months ago, after being accused of cheating by some players on the PS4, I decided to start making videos of my gameplay and also to use the forums more, where I made some good friends and haven\u2019t looked back since.\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\ntwitch.tv/Hatch___,\nyoutube.com/hatch-hitman, \nhitmanforum.com/jdmhatch_g\nPlease tell us about some of the contracts you\u2019ve chosen and why you think they deserve to be featured?\nThe majority of these contracts will offer the player a fair amount of freedom in their decisions, and then there are some great puzzle types thrown in too. The batch is intended to be relatively simple, stress free and most importantly, fun. Some of the contracts have interesting backstories behind them too, I think?\nFor those players that like the puzzle types, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye out for \u201cThe Portman Shuffle\u201d which was created by Urben, the puzzle contract master. It\u2019s a 2 target contract, set in Hokkaido, involving thrown scissors.\nAnd for Marrakesh, \u201cSending a Message\u201d where you have to kill the Prisoner with an Assault Rifle while wearing your best suit. For an extra challenge, see if you can do it with a loud rifle!\n\nHow did you go about choosing the 10 contracts?\nI took full advantage of all the best resources available to me, which were; some good friends that collectively have 10\u2019s of thousands of hours in the game, the Contract Search function in-game, Kotti\u2019s awesome contract database \u2013 HitmanDB.com and of course, the Members Contracts Thread on HitmanForum.com. \nI didn\u2019t have a problem finding good contracts, but to find something that feels different to the myriad of existing Featured Contracts and Escalations, because IOI have done such an amazing job with feeding us content every month, that was tricky. I feel confident in my choices though, and I think there is something for everyone, no matter your play style.\nWhat is the one item you always take into a contract with you and why do you like it so much?\nThe Breaching Charges. They are easily the most useful item in the game. They can open doors and safes, destroy electrical sockets, winches and ignite fire barrels, as well as kill, distract and lure NPC\u2019s, and even launch weapons and items across the map. There are very few contracts where they aren\u2019t useful for something.\nAs the third\u00a0Contract Curator, how did you enjoy the other Curated Contracts chosen by Mendietinha and Mungadungalis?\nMendie and Munga know both the game and the players very well and it was evident in their choices as I enjoyed their batches thoroughly. Difficult to follow up on.\nI think my favourites had to be \u201cThe Closter Calculation\u201d by Monkey_Triads (chosen by Munga) which had 47 killing 4 targets in Sapienza, in the suit, any method for 3 targets and 1 kitchen knife restriction which I thought was a nice touch.\nAnd, I also loved \u201cBodyguard Hater\u201d by GuLe (chosen by Mendie), even though it has Sophus Fatale as a target, and he isn\u2019t a bodyguard \ud83d\ude09 it can be played in so many different ways, and since this game is all about replay-ability, it\u2019s a lot of fun. GuLe knows how to make a top quality contract.\nIf you could choose one location for 47 to visit in our next Hitman game, where would it be?\nI think London would make for some incredible Hitman gameplay. Offering an almost endless selection of disguise possibilities and many varied, interesting places to explore. You have everything from hotels to museums and art galleries, to shops and bars, office buildings, theatres, churches etc etc. Plus, it won\u2019t matter that 90% of the NPC\u2019s accents are British \ud83d\ude09\nNow is your chance to share or say one last thing before you go. Have at it!\nI\u2019d like to thank everyone at Io-Interactive for all their awesome games and for the community the Hitman games have produced. I\u2019m certain that I never would have spent the number of hours I have in this game, if it wasn\u2019t for the community and friends, and this is my chance to give something back. Thank you for asking me to be the 3rd curator, and I hope the players enjoy the selection. Happy killing, agents.\nThanks Hatch!\nIt\u2019s been my pleasure. Thank you.\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-hatch/"},

Join the conversation on Hitman Forum.\nMaster Scarecrow Challenge Pack\nColorado is the only location yet to have an added Challenge Pack. That ends this month with the release of The Master Scarecrow Challenge Pack. Look forward to 5 new challenges, each with a high amount of location mastery; a great way to top out your mastery and collect any remaining unlocks. Completing all of the challenges will unlock a new item for 47 to use in all locations.\n\n\u00a0\nArriving Later in October\nOur next batch of 10\u00a0player-curated Featured Contracts arrives later in the month. These contracts function in the same way to the Featured Contracts that you\u2019ve come to know and love in the game, with one big twist: one of our players will curate the list.\nThe third curator to be in the spotlight is Hatch. He\u2019s a British speedrunner who plays on PS4 in search of unique routes on fun contracts.\u00a0You\u2019ll get to know him even better later in the month when his curated contracts go live in the game and we publish a blog post right here with some insights into his choices.\n\nLooking Ahead: Save The Date!\nMark this date on your calendars: October 24th. That\u2019s the date when we will reveal brand new content for the game.\nWe\u2019re going to let the announcement itself do all the talking, but there is one thing we want to clarify before then; this upcoming content is not \u201cSeason 2\u201d. We\u2019re saying that now to keep expectations in check.\nSo, save the date, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t leak and we\u2019ll see you there!\n/ Travis\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-october-content-schedule/"},
{"title": "Community Focus \u2013 Mungadungalis", "date": "September 19, 2017", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn August, we introduced a new type of live content into our schedule: player-curated Featured Contracts! Our first curator was Mendietinha, who picked out 10 contracts for August.\nWe\u2019ve already announced in the September Content Schedule that our next curator is another well-known Hitman player; you know him as Mungadungalis. Before you get the chance to play the 10 contracts that he\u2019s chosen tomorrow, we\u2019re putting him under the spotlight to find out more about him. Let\u2019s go!\n\u00a0\nHello Mungadungalis!\nHello Hitman, and Hitman fans everywhere!\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019ve agreed to curate some Featured Contracts! Please tell us about yourself and how people in the Hitman community know about you\u2026\nPlease, call me Munga. \nI host a live stream several times a week on Twitch featuring mostly Hitman.\nWe are an amazing community of Hitman players of all ages and nationalities. If you haven\u2019t yet, come on by and check us out. All are welcome and it\u2019s usually a party, with some salt, some sugar, and lots of RIPPIPPIPPIPParooos!\nAlthough I\u2019ve been playing video games since the days of PONG, HITMAN 2016 was actually my first Hitman experience. I started playing about a week after the first episode was released and I haven\u2019t stopped since. I love this game.\n\u00a0\nWhere can people find/watch/follow you online?\nYou can check out my live stream at: twitch.tv/mungadungalis \u00a0\n\nI also have a youtube channel: youtube.com/mungadungalis\nDon\u2019t forget my twitter: twitter.com/mungadungalis\n\u00a0\nPlease tell us about some of the contracts you\u2019ve chosen and why you think they deserve to be featured?\n\nI tried to choose contracts that are fun, flow from one target to the next, and can be done in a variety of ways. Some are designed to be quick, some take a bit longer and some have some puzzles to work out.\n\u00a0\nHow did you go about choosing the 10 contracts?\nWell, I had people bring their contracts to the stream, I searched the forums, and I also searched random contracts using the contract search feature. Then, I played them until I was able to get a Silent Assassin rating and made sure they weren\u2019t too infuriating. Finding good contracts was easy,\u2026 selecting only ten was much harder.\n\u00a0\nWhat is the one item you always take into a contract with you and why do you like it so much?\nThe Big One! I like to bring The Big One with me whenever possible. Not only is it a lot of fun to play with, it has many hidden properties. It\u2019s perfect for this game. Take a chance, whip out The Big One. You may be pleasantly surprised.\n\u00a0\nWhat has been your highlight from the first season and what would you most like to see in the future of HITMAN?\nThat\u2019s easy. The Gary Busey Elusive Target \u2013 The Wild Card! The community voted for their pick; Either Gary Busey or Gary Cole. It must\u2019ve cost a fortune but that was fantastic. I think Busey won by a landslide. I would love to see more of this type of stuff! It was hilarious and there were a ton of opportunities to take him out.\u00a0\u00a0 *sings \u201c\u2026I\u2019m Freakin\u2019 Busey!!\u201d \nI re-painted the interior of the church shed with his innards. Sorry Gary. \n\u00a0\nAnything else you want to share or say before you go? \nI hope people like at least some of the contracts I\u2019ve chosen. Thank you all for trusting me to be curator.\nHitman is an amazing game with an equally amazing community and I\u2019m really happy to be part of it. I also want to thank the Hitman developers. Not only for this opportunity (I\u2019m very flattered and honored) but for the attention paid by developers to the Hitman players. I understand that you guys can\u2019t fix everything, and sometimes I rage about certain bugs etc\u2026 (fix that %#^$&amp;@# ____!) but never in my gaming experience have I seen a team that listens to their community like IO does. \nKeep up the amazing job, and bring on Season 2!\n\u00a0\nThanks Munga!\nYou\u2019re welcome, and thanks to the entire Hitman community.\nI get to meet Diana now, right? \n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-focus-mungadungalis/"},
{"title": "HITMAN Comic Book Announcement", "date": "September 11, 2017", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe\u2019re very excited to announce that we are working with Dynamite Entertainment to create a comic book based in the HITMAN universe. The new series, titled Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman will delve into the origins of Agent 47 and is directly connected to the overarching story that we introduced with HITMAN. Issue #1 is scheduled for release on November 1st 2017!\n\nThe team here at IOI has full creative control of the story and character development that is presented through the comic book. We feel that is best to ensure all story elements fit together seamlessly and to deliver a comic book that our players will enjoy reading and exploring more of Agent 47\u2019s past.\nWe\u2019ve been working with the talented team at Dynamite to also make sure that the look of Agent 47 fits perfectly with the stories that we want to tell in the comic books, as well as Diana and the other recognisable characters from their past. Writer Christopher Sebela (Hellraiser,\u00a0Injustice: Ground Zero, Green Lantern/Space Ghost) and artist Jonathan Lau (Bionic Man,\u00a0Battlestar Galactica) are both fans of the Hitman games and can\u2019t wait to get \u2018Birth of the Hitman\u2019 out in the world. Neither can we. This is our chance to add a new chapter to the story of Agent 47 and reimagine some of the themes to fit with the current tone and creative vision of our latest game.\nAs the game\u2019s Lead Writer, Michael Vogt is in the best position to talk a bit more about what that creative vision is and give some insights into what to expect from \u2018Birth of the Hitman\u2019:\n\u201dDuring the release and promotion of HITMAN, we said very little about the overarching story or where it was heading, preferring to let it linger in the background and give players space to explore our world of assassination on their own terms.\nHowever, as became clear after Colorado, the new emerging story line has deep ties to Agent 47\u2019s untold past.\nExploring 47\u2019s young adulthood, while updating his origin story to a new generation of fans, is something we have wanted to do for a while. This story, however, is much too big for the game. That is where the comic book by Dynamite Entertainment comes in.\nThe comic, which is an integral part of the HITMAN universe and is directly connected to the game\u2019s unfolding story line, will focus on key events of the past \u2013 starting with the intertwined origin stories of; 47, his friend Subject 6 and his future handler Diana Burnwood. The comic will add new layers of character depth to our main cast, while allowing us to tell stories that simply don\u2019t work in a sandbox game. I am super excited about this and I hope new and old fans alike will embrace the comic book as well.\u201c\nIt\u2019s important to note that the game\u2019s story and the comic book are complimentary and intertwined, but can also be enjoyed separately.\nWe can\u2019t wait to see the reaction to issue #1 in October.\n\nComic book fans are encouraged to reserve copies of\u00a0Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman #1\u00a0with their local comic book retailers.\u00a0Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman #1\u00a0will also be available for individual customer purchase through digital platforms courtesy of\u00a0Comixology,\u00a0Kindle,\u00a0iBooks,\u00a0Google Play,\u00a0Dynamite Digital,\u00a0iVerse,\u00a0Madefire, and\u00a0Dark Horse Digital.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-comic-book-announcement/"},

The Plumber\u2019s Apprentice Challenge Pack adds 5 new challenges to Sapienza, each with a high amount of location mastery.

This is a fresh twist on Featured Contracts because we\u2019re asking some of the most prominent and well-known members of our community to pick out the contracts that have caught their attention.\nThe first player-curated Featured Contracts will be released on August 25th, but before then, we are also introducing a new theme of blog posts to go alongside our player-curated Contracts: Community Spotlight. Our contract curator for August is Mendietinha \u2013 and so he\u2019s the first person to face the spotlight!\n\nHey Mendietinha, or can we call you Mendie?\nOh, please call me Mendie. Its easier to spell haha!\nCan you tell us about yourself and how people in the Hitman community know you?\nWell, I\u2019ve been a gamer my entire life, so, after my short career as a soccer player was over due to a knee injury, I decided to dedicate myself more and more to playing games and know more about computers. I have played older Hitman games, but it was Blood Money that got me good! I started watching YouTube videos of it, and the crazy ideas on how to complete the missions started to pop into my mind. Ever since, I recorded and uploaded most of those runs to YouTube and when the new game came out, well, I kept going on trying to make the unlikely work! That lead me to forums and finally, to streams, where most of the community got to know me; as a speedrunner /mad scientist haha!\nWhere\u2019s the best place for other players to find you online?\u00a0\nYou can find me on twitch.tv/mendietinha, youtube.com/mendietinha, twitter.com/mendietinha. \nPretty simple, eh?\nSounds simple enough\u2026 Now, let\u2019s get down to it: You are our very first contract curator! \nPlease tell us about some of the contracts you\u2019ve chosen and why you think they deserve to be featured.\nIt\u2019s a gift to be the very first, and I am very thankful for it!\u00a0About the contracts, I\u00a0 want to talk about two of them in particular:\n\u201cBodyguard Hater\u201d by Gule. This is an excellent\u00a0example of a top quality contract. Fun, tricky and with multiple approaches. You are so close from the Big Shots, but they are not the targets! Combine all that and you can get them in so many ways I can\u2019t count myself.\nAlso, another really great contract is \u201cThe Jingles Menace 2.0\u201d. You may ask yourself why the 2.0? Well, the creator, Hitman Master CJ, decided to remove a sniper restriction from it, which opened more windows of opportunity, and that is something I care very much about. The targets are well placed, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s a cakewalk! Think outside the box here.\nEnjoy it! Take your time. Set traps, run for it, walk for it. The idea is to provide fun, freedom and some challenges for you to crack.\nWhen you\u2019re not cherry-picking contracts, what\u2019s your default loadout for a contract?\nALWAYS bring your duck. That\u2019s what I always say. So that would be the Silverballer, red duck, breaching charges and a Jaeger Lancer hidden somewhere.\u00a0 Also, I would like to advise players to do some recon before going for a contract. Start it in a safe location, locate your targets, observe their routes and try to find windows of opportunity for them, and only then choose your loadout. Timing\u00a0is also a crucial factor, as, for example, an explosion kill can change all of your plans if it affects other targets reactions \ud83d\ude09\nIf you look into your crystal ball, what would you most like to see in the future of HITMAN?\nMore and more content, Season 2, 3\u2026 and the Wallbang power of the Lancer back at some point. I\u2019m a simple man, with a wallbang desire haha. Also, the idea of having the old bullet distraction back is a thing that would open lots of ways to complete and plan not only contracts, but main missions and escalations as well.\nAnd finally\u2026 Is there anything else you want to share?\nFor our community, just keep playing Hitman! Think outside the box, try silly things, have fun! If you are not playing Hitman yet, start now!\nThanks Mendie!\nThank you!\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/community-spotlight-mendietinha/"},

Every month, we pick out the best of the Contracts that have been submitted, shared with us or that we\u2019ve seen discussed among our players. We choose the contracts as a batch to make sure we include a variety of locations, varying numbers of targets, inventive storytelling and anything else that we think is interesting.\nAlso on August 11th, we\u2019ll release a new Challenge Pack.\u00a0This will be the sixth one released so far and is called \u2018The Art of Revenge\u2019. Five new challenges will be added to the game and, as with all previous Challenge Packs, the location mastery you can earn by completing those challenges is higher than the regular challenges. That makes them a great\u00a0way to earn any remaining mastery unlocks you need. The five challenges will be added to Hokkaido and you\u2019ll need to complete all of the challenges to unlock the unique item, which we will reveal next week. After all, revenge is never a straight line\u2026\nLater in August, we\u2019ll also publish our first-ever player-curated Featured Contracts. These contracts will function in the same way to the Featured Contracts that you\u2019ve come to know and love in the game, with one big twist: one of our players will curate the list. These player-curated contracts will offer a fresh twist to the style of contracts that will be featured in the game and give all players a chance to get an insight into how some of the prominent members of the Hitman community play the game.\nThe very first curator to be in the spotlight is Mendietinha. He\u2019s a Brazilian streamer who lives for discovering new routes in contracts and the ultimate rekky. If you don\u2019t already watch his almost-daily Twitch streams, you\u2019ll get to know him better later in the month when his curated contracts go live in the game and we publish a blog post right here with some insights into his choices.\nFinally, there is no game update in the pipeline for this month but we are working towards future game updates.\nLooking ahead, the\u00a0September Content Schedule will be similar to this one, with a focus on Contracts Mode and a new Challenge Pack. That relative calm will give us time to prepare for some exciting announcements.\n/ Travis\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-august-content-schedule/"},

This month is a bit special because it brings the final Elusive Target for Season One. On top of that, we have a new Escalation Contract in Sapienza, a fresh (and super-sized) batch of Featured Contracts and the July game update.\nThe first content to arrive on 7th July is this month\u2019s Escalation Contract; The Hamartia Compulsion.\n\u2013 This Escalation Contract is the 12th that we have released for Sapienza and challenges you with 5 different stages. Expect three different targets, a sticky pistol complication and a few other surprises.\n\nOnce you have completed all 5 stages, earned the corresponding challenge and Mastery XP, we\u2019ve lined up a bumper selection of Featured Contracts for July.\nContracts Mode allows you to create your own contracts and share them with friends, adding to the already insane replay-ability offered across all locations. Every month, we pick out the best of the Contracts that have been submitted, shared with us or that we\u2019ve seen discussed among our players.\n15 new Featured Contracts will be added to the game on 7th July and this week\u2019s featured contract creators are\u2026 Quinez, Spodeq, AGENT4T7, BernardoOne, Euler 13, Gule, Pagan, GKPunk, Urben, Ed ll3, Niobium, immadummee, Silverballer, SnakeGun and Mendietinha.\nOur\u00a0July content will be released over a few different dates. The final Elusive Target for Season One will arrive later in the month and will be on the Marrakesh Bonus mission; A House Built on Sand. As the contract is in Marrakesh, you\u2019ll unlock the Summer Suit with Gloves if this is the first ET you complete in Marrakesh. Equally, if you earn your first SA rating for this ET, you\u2019ll unlock the Terminus Suit. Check the challenges in-game to see what suits you can still unlock through Elusive Targets, all depending on how many of the previous Elusive Targets you\u2019ve completed.\nWe are also planning a game update for this month. We\u2019ll have details to share and full release notes closer to when we\u2019re releasing it.\nSee you for some new challenges in the August Content Schedule.\n/ Travis\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-july-content-schedule/"},

With our latest game, we have not only transformed Hitman, but also moved our entire studio into the AAA digital era. Our live product has disrupted the video game business and has received recognition and praise from press, community and our fans.\nThere are many tales of hope, dreams, hardship and joy within these walls. We have never strived for the expected or predictable. Instead, we are always in pursuit for what feels original and real.\u00a0Our passion and determination has never been greater and so that is why we have decided it is not the time to stop as we have many more exciting and original tales to tell.\nTherefore I am proud to announce today that IOI is now officially an independent studio. We have successfully concluded our negotiations with Square Enix and have agreed to a management buyout. Crucially, we will keep all of the rights to the Hitman IP.\u00a0\nThis is a watershed moment for IOI. As of today, we have complete control over the direction for our studio and the Hitman IP \u2013 we\u2019re about to forge our own future and it\u2019s incredibly exciting. We are now open to opportunities with future collaborators and partners to help strengthen us as a studio and ensure that we can produce the best games possible for our community.\nI would like to say a big and sincere thank you to all of our players, community, friends in the media and everyone else connected to the studio for the messages of support that we have received in the last few weeks. I would also like to thank Square Enix; it has been a great family to be a part of and we are proud of what we have achieved together in the last eight years. IOI started as an independent studio and we will now return to those roots with an extremely passionate and talented team.\nWe are counting on the continued support of all our players; simply by having fun with everything we\u2019ve released so far for HITMAN \u2013 and we want to encourage more of you to try our game.

{"title": "Store Changes for HITMAN", "date": "June 7, 2017", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn the coming weeks, we will be making changes to the options for purchasing HITMAN digitally. These changes have been planned since early March and will make it easier and simpler to buy the game. Our intention is to make \u2018The Complete First Season\u2019 the default option for new players to buy the game, now that all of the episodes have been released. Additionally, these changes will help us to lay the foundations for our future plans for HITMAN.\nWe are announcing these changes today, to make sure that existing players are fully aware of their options and to give a fair amount of time before these changes come into effect.\nHere\u2019s the core of the changes:\nIn approximately 2 weeks time, The \u2018Intro Pack\u2019 and \u2018Upgrade Pack\u2019 will be removed from digital stores and will no longer be available for purchase.\nAs the HITMAN pages on digital storefronts will look a little different in 2 weeks, here\u2019s\u00a0what to expect on each platform:\nSteam:\u00a0After the changes, Intro Pack owners will be able to purchase \u2018The Complete First Season\u2019 and only pay for the episodes that they do not already own. Essentially, Steam will detect which episodes you have already purchased and only charge you for the ones you do not own.

Hakan has been at IOI for more than 10 years, spearheading the latest HITMAN episodic release and is a proven and experienced leader and passionate gamer.\n\nI am humbled and truly proud to take on the role of Studio Head at Io-Interactive. This is a studio I am fiercely passionate about, both in terms of who we are and what we do and I will now work resolutely to lead IOI forwards for our next exciting chapters.\nI want to start by saying a huge thank you to my friend and mentor, Hannes Seifert. Hannes decided that the time was right for him to leave Square Enix for pastures new and move onto a project closer to his home in Austria, it\u2019s been quite a long commute for 7 years..! Hannes has been an exemplary Studio Head and we wish him the very best for the future.\nI started here at IOI as a Producer 10 years ago, moving through to my last position as Studio Production Director. I\u2019ve seen the shift in the studio, how we\u2019ve matured into who we are today and I like to believe I\u2019ve been a central part of that change.\nAs a team we have taken bold steps with our beloved Hitman brand, introducing the first AAA episodic Hitman experience. We have released weekly content since our launch in March 2016 on top of keeping to the rhythm of each episode release. We have innovated with the introduction of Elusive Targets, our time-limited one-shot targets, which have created a genuine tension in gameplay which we had never before experienced in any game like this. And the result of all this as we rounded off 2016 and into 2017 was multiple Game of the Year awards and callouts for the incredible experience we have created with Hitman.\nWe have learnt to be more open to our community and players, to listen and learn and this is something we will get even better at as we move forwards. And above all, we have learnt not to fear change, but to embrace it.\nAs a studio, we have established a strong direction for Hitman and we will continue to innovate and push into the digital gaming space as we strive to build unique experiences in gaming.\nHakan\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/new-studio-head-ioi/"},

From meeting rooms named after our games, to chill-out areas and\u00a0everything else we need for day-to-day work.\nIt was also important for us to have a studio that is fun to be in and that can spark creativity at almost every corner. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve made sure that the studio is\u00a0equally prepared for spontaneous table-football tournaments or high-score competitions on arcade machines.\n \u00a0\nTo mark the occasion, we asked our Studio Head, Hannes Seifert, to say a few words:\n\u201cIOI has always been a studio that creates unique and interesting games. It comes from the idea that we want our games to play and feel like the people that create them. Our new studio is the perfect place to continue doing that. It\u2019s an energetic, high-tech and exciting place to work that has been created specifically for our needs as an ambitious development studio.\u00a0Our new logo is fresh, contemporary and expresses our creativity, ambition and passion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/new-studio-logo-ioi/"},

Plus, we\u2019ll have the usual array of weapon and gear unlocks that can be used across all previous locations.\n\nHere are a few words from our Studio Head, Hannes Seifert:\n\u201cIt was a brave decision to go fully digital episodic with Hitman, fundamentally changing how we make the game, and for us it has been a major success. I want to say a big thank you to all the players for making this possible!

So the team set out to build a location that was both teeming with life and things to do. Marrakesh has been built with a maze of alleys, a range of souks that line the medina walls and a fully fletched shisha caf\u00e9. Moving upwards, players can enjoy the shade on the signature rooftop terraces of Marrakesh.\n\nJust beyond the busy marketplace, you will find an architectural marvel in the shape of the Swedish Consulate building. The very embodiment of minimalistic Scandinavian design, a mix of glass, concrete and wood offering a powerful contrast to the blazing heat just outside its walls.\nAs with any Hitman level, Marrakesh promises players the lure of voyeurism and the thrill of infiltration and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been working hard on getting just right. Offering two targets, the \u201cGilded Cage\u201d mission challenges players to eliminate private banker Claus Strandberg, holed up inside the secure Swedish Consulate, and army General Reza Zaydan, protected by his elite squad of soldiers at a temporary headquarters in the heart of the city. Both targets will be challenging to reach and both will of course have some entertaining special moments attached to them that will allow players to dole out some poetic justice.\nWith Marrakesh also comes a lot more live content for players to engage with and the busy markets and locked down consulate will provide us with great settings for our live features.

Agent 47 is the aspirational assassin, he\u2019s at the absolute peak of his power this time around. This is our central promise: a pure assassin fantasy. So we liked the simplicity and the power of calling this game HITMAN. We want him to be powerful and embody the fantasy completely, and he will remain a constant throughout everything we do with the games going forward.\nSo what is this new game? Well first off HITMAN is still a creative stealth action game, featuring the greatest assassin out there, Agent 47. As an operative of the International Contract Agency, his job is to take out high-profile targets all over the world, supported by his long-time handler Diana Burnwood. Each location in the game is a living sandbox, a place where every NPC has a name and every room matters. We\u2019ve focused on making sure you, the players, have complete freedom of approach over how, where and when you decide to take out your target. Creativity from players is fully expected, you have the power and intelligence of Agent 47 at your fingertips and it is your choice whether to use brute force or orchestrate a genuine masterpiece of assassination.\n\n\u00a0\nLocations are more detailed, more populated and much larger than ever before, full of things to experiment with and targets to kill without any checkpoint systems in there. Contracts mode, which we\u2019ll talk more about later in the year, returns and really shines in these big sandboxes. We\u2019ve brought back save games, so you can save your progress anywhere, and we have revamped pretty much every system in our Glacier engine to enable this HITMAN experience. We promised you these things a while back and we\u2019re sticking to them because they are important \u2013 and because your feedback is important. In fact, it\u2019s so important we\u2019re taking things a step further.\nA live experience\nOne of the reasons why we\u2019re calling this a new start for HITMAN is also the idea of releasing a digitally led product. That can mean a lot of different things depending on who you are, but for us it means we\u2019re going to make HITMAN available first via direct download.\nWe\u2019re embracing what digital can offer a blockbuster game series like HITMAN \u2013 it allows us to do things that are both bold and exciting and entirely new to the Hitman experience.\n\n\u00a0\nWe are building an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience will begin on December 8th and we will release new locations, missions and hits over time at regular intervals through 2016, which means we\u2019ll all be able to share in the excitement of a new content drop at the same time. Rather than unboxing a game, playing it and then that\u2019s sort of it, we want to deliver a true community experience \u2013 creating an ongoing and evolving game which plays out with a finale that brings the story arc together. Our primary goal is to keep HITMAN players fully engaged, so between bigger drops we will be creating one-off live events and live targets to keep you immersed in the experience.\nImagine a target appearing for every player in the world, for a limited time only\u2026 let\u2019s say 48 hours. Where your one shot counts. And when that target is gone, it is gone forever. A shared experience where we imagine the HITMAN community will come together every time a new mission or new location appears. For $60 you\u2019ll get full access to all of this content \u2013 everything we release as part of this story.\nAnother big part of this new approach is that we will develop the game with you, the players, and adjust gameplay and create live content and events based on player activity and feedback \u2013 so the game will deepen and evolve as time progresses. The experience begins on December 8th on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC and will reach well into 2016.\nExclusives and beta\nIf you saw HITMAN revealed at the Sony E3 Press Conference, you heard the word \u201cexclusive\u201d a couple of times. We\u2019d just quickly like to run through what that means. PlayStation 4 will be the only console where you can experience the beta and where you can play it first. A PC beta is planned to arrive a week later. The beta is available for pre-orders now. As for the PlayStation 4 exclusive contracts, they are only available to those people who own a PS4 copy of the game.\nOne more thing\nThe journey has just started for us all. We are incredibly excited to share a lot more with you as 2015 unfolds. For now, please enjoy the newly revealed gameplay trailer.\n\nWe\u2019re very happy to invite you into this world of assassination. It\u2019s a place full of challenges, contracts, hits, targets, opportunities, choices and freedom. We can\u2019t wait to show you more!\nSee you in the trenches.\n Io-Interactive\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/announcing_hitman/"},

{"title": "HITMAN 3 \u2013 Dartmoor", "date": "August 20, 2000", "text": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDiscover the secrets of an old manor and uncover clues to solve the Thornbridge Mystery. Welcome to Dartmoor \u2013 a new location coming to HITMAN 3.\n\nDARTMOOR\nWe\u2019ve shown you Dubai. Now it\u2019s time for Dartmoor.\nHITMAN 3\u2019s second mission location takes you to a historical part of England known for its grassy meadows, rocky hilltops, winding rivers and dense wetlands. Dartmoor also has a reputation for myths, legends and mysteries \u2013 and Thornbridge Manor lives up to that!\nThe Thornbridge Mystery trailer focuses on just one of the Mission Stories available to players in Dartmoor. Besides playing detective and piecing the mystery together, you\u2019ll have full freedom to explore and create your own plans. Today, we\u2019re focusing on the \u2018murder mystery\u2019 element of the mission because it\u2019s unique and something we\u2019ve always thought about doing \u2018one day\u2019. We\u2019ve even talked about HITMAN games as a \u2018reverse murder mystery\u2019 in the past. Typically, a murder mystery tasks you with figuring out how someone has died, whereas in Hitman, you need to figure out how to kill someone. In HITMAN 3\u2019s Dartmoor location, those worlds collide as you can take on the role of detective to solve a murder and eliminate your target. Two birds, one disguise.\n\n\nAt the IOI Copenhagen office, we have a whiteboard dedicated to this mission. It\u2019s sat near our writers and is full of post-its, scribbles and pieces of string that connect different pieces of information. It\u2019s got way too many spoilers on it, so we can\u2019t share it here but we\u2019ll save some photos for another day. For a visual reference, think of the the wall you see at the end of the Colorado mission in HITMAN 1. This one.\n\nTo tell you more about what it\u2019s like working on the Dartmoor location, here\u2019s Nick Price, Lead Writer on HITMAN 3:\n\u201cHITMAN missions are very complicated affairs with plenty of moving parts and lots of characters you are able to interact with in a huge variety of ways. In Dartmoor\u2019s murder mystery, we are dialing all of that up to 11. \nEvery member of the family is a possible suspect and it\u2019s been quite the challenge to make sure everything doesn\u2019t fall apart just because the player wants to play around. In fact, that sort of behaviour should be rewarded in a HITMAN game, so we have been working hard on making sure that depending on what a player discovers during their investigation, outcomes might differ. It\u2019s going to be great fun to see how everyone tackles this particular problem next year.\u201d\n\n\nPRE-ORDERS\nHITMAN 3 pre-orders are scheduled to go live later this month and we\u2019re pleased to have an updated line-up of platforms. In January 2021, you\u2019ll be able to play HITMAN 3 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, Google Stadia and PC, where the game will be available exclusively via Epic Games Store for 12 months.\nAs an independent studio, our partnership with Epic has given us the freedom to create HITMAN 3 exactly as we imagined and self-publish the game to our players directly. It\u2019s also important to us that we honour the time our existing PC players have spent in our previous games.\nWith that in mind, we are pleased to confirm that PC players will be able to carryover their current progression and unlocks from HITMAN 2 on Steam into HITMAN 3 on Epic Games Store. It will also be possible for PC players to import locations from the previous two games into HITMAN 3 on Epic Games Store. We want to make it a seamless process for our PC players to enjoy HITMAN 3 on a different PC platform and continue to enjoy the benefits of our World of Assassination.\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t", "url": "https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-dartmoor/"}
